## Behavior

After [[Iconic pact of the Silver Wolves|forming]] their [[iconic pact of the Silver Wolves|iconic pact with the Wolf Mother]], the newly formed Silver Wolves returned noticeably different, their nature more wolf-like in many ways. Their behavior and social interactions changed significantly, aligning more closely with those of a pack of wolves. Previously coming from most of the disparate [[human clans]], they largely broke off these ties to become more insular within their new pack.

Sub-groups would arise within the [[Clan Wolfstepper|Clan]], but the rule of the pack was above all but the word of the [[Lunar Aspects#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]] herself. The pack was to be protected from both harm brought by enemies and by unnecessary mixing with their human neighbors. They were the last of their kind, the last wolves of the [[Known World]], and the survival and proliferation of the pack was paramount to the Wolf Mother's very first prophecy:

### Connection with the night

Though not truly nocturnal, their connection with the [[silver moon]] as well as their enhanced senses make the Silver Wolves well suited to the environment of the night. Later – after the founding of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] – it was common to see a squad roaming the streets or the rooftops of the [[Old City]] during the day, but a great many more would go completely unnoticed at night.

During the [[Elven March|Elven March period]], this made them proficient night watchers, even more so than the ever vigilant [[Sun Elves]] of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]].

### Rendezvous with the Wolf Mother

Every full moon, the elders of the pack would recuse themselves of their human neighbors and venture deep into the forests to summon the counsel of their [[iconic pacts|patron]], the [[Lunar Aspects#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]]. This mysterious ritual would not be understood by the humans until after the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of their protectors the [[Silver Wolves]]. Although the Silver Wolves were seen and treated with much reverence, this was the source of constant speculation by the other [[human clans|clans]].
