The Mouseion serves as the mecca of the arts in the [[Known World]]. Inspired by the bardistry of the [[Elven Legion|Elven]] [[Griot|Griots]], humanity's artists create and perform and present here, their works spilling out into the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s many streets and squares and gardens. Many of the [[Great Works]] were created by its members under commission by the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]].
