- Begins in media res during the last raid of the [[Akụm|Akụm marauders]]
- Warrior classes and members of the populace alike fending off this bloodthirsty frenzy
- Last gasps of the defeated Akụm which hint at the [[Lunar Aspects#<strike>The Fallen Son</strike>|Fallen Son]]; his fate in the deepest, darkest depths of the [[Sink]]; and some vague culture around worshipping him
- The tide begins to turn, hinting at their accursed [[organic magics]]
- An army of gargantuan, alien allies emerges from the Sink and saves the day
- Describe the [[Oklop]], who end the conflict and send the frenzy fleeing with a fearful look in their eyes
- Describe the forming of a relationship between humanity in the City and the Oklop
	- They came following the light of the [[Elven Signaltower]]
	- Relationship centered around the trading of trinkets and bobbles
- Describe the building up of the Oklop consortium along the [[Sun Coast]]
- And the Akụm marauders never raided the City of Gardens again
