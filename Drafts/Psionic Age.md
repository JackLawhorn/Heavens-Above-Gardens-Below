The so-called "Psionic Age" describes a period in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and the [[Early Renascence period]] when [[psionics]] in the [[Known World]] – first [[mystic psionics]] as a [[magics in the Known World|field of magics]] and then the [[scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist studies]] of the [[Psionics College]] – was discovered and rapidly rose to prominence.

## Dawn of the Psionic Age

The dawn of the Psionic Age is demarked by the rise of [[Disciples of the Pretender|the Pretender and their Disciples]], which revealed the field of [[psionics]] itself to humanity and to the [[Known World]]. These first psions practiced what is now called [[mystic psionics]], and ultimately left [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] on [[Questing Charter of the Disciples of the Pretender|religious pilgrimage]] to the [[Deep Deserts]]. There, they fell to the powerful psionic forces of the [[Deep Deserts#Mirage|Mirages]].

Back in the City, the remaining human psions were inspired by this loss to pursue the field as an [[scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist science]]. This new [[scholars of the City|class of scholars]] founded the [[Psionics College]] which, throughout the Psionic Age, rose so much in prominence that they took the place of the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fallen]] [[Materialists College]]. As a result, the remainder of this period saw the exploration of this exciting new frontier: both the field of psionics and the [[Psionic Sphere]] itsel.
