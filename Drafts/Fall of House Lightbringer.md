The House Torchbearer traces back to those humans who followed closest behind the Elves at the front of the Elven March. As if by osmosis they absorbed Elven combat techniques and reverence towards battle, leading them to become the greatest human warriors after the Lycans themselves. Later, each fighting man and woman among them would volunteer their lives as the soldiers and guards of the City of Gardens.

Children of legend, they were granted Houseship and later Great Houseship almost by default. For generations, they protected their people before looking to lead their people into the future. The noble Lady Anastasia set out with her Lord and ten thousand men, betraying their overconfidence by choosing to go East and round the coastline of the Great Sea. For decades, they cut and slashed their way through untamed wilderness -- attacked by monstrous creatures and unknown illnesses against which they had little defense.

Their first significant loss came as they approached the bend and hundreds -- including Lady Anastasia herself -- fell ill with a deadly fever. Her will is said to have kept her alive for months, but this only slowed their march until her death. By all accounts driven to madness in grief, the Lord did manage to break through and round the coastline and they finally came upon a great tree with bark as dark as the Nyx itself and leaves that appeared as if made of pure gold.

By then the House Torchbearer's forces had been diminished to little over one hundred fighting men and women, and so the party made camp among the gargantuan roots to rest and prepare to signal home. As they explored this potential new home of man, they were met by weak, desperate bat-like creatures who nevertheless attacked them with all their might. The House was victorious but those who sustained injuries quickly became delirious and fell ill, all while the Lord sat alone with his grief. When the Lord finally left his tent, his men had devolved into the same bat-like creatures they had slaughtered.

Too late, he saw the great tree for what it was. The bark was in fact sickly and gnarled, the leaves not gold but yellow and dying, and the trunk strangled by hideous, barbed strangler vines. He had become a slave to his hunger -- that very same that had felled his Lady and trapped him here -- and this hunger strangled his very being like the strangler vines that now beckoned and whispered to him. Like any slave, he was shackled here and to this day remains at the foot of the tree as emissary to the Icon of Hunger and leader of the bat-like creatures his men had become.

When aid finally arrived from the City of Gardens via ship to answer their smoke signal, they too were set upon by the creatures. Barely surviving to see home again, they brought with them the Curseplague of Hunger which ravaged the City for years and which remains hidden in back alleys and shuttered plague dens to this day. The ships also brought with them legends of the Lord, now more tree than flesh and wrapped with barbed, black strangler vines.

The House Torchbearer were heroes in their time and achieved heights that would not be seen again for centuries. They represented the shared mission of the First Province of Man: to create a new and prosperous place in this world for humans. Their fall teaches us to be weary of the Hunger, and not to confuse it for the call of righteous destiny.
