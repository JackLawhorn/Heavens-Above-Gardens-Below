In a remote edge of what the humans call the [[Nyx]], but in reality is simply the [[Prime Material Sphere]] and one of many. On a pitiful world, a [[fallen world]] no longer pertinent to the divine plans of [[Ylem]] and its [[Angels]]. Far to the east of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] on the shores of the [[Sun Coast]]. Stranded months from home and now without their most powerful warriors: the [[Oremongers Guild#Artificer knights|artificer knights]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]].

_Here, in this dark and treacherous place, humanity of the Known World first falls victim to the [[Red Court|Hunger]], child of the [[Dragon]] itself and a scourge upon reality._

The noble Captain Torchbearer set out with her Lord and ten thousand men, betraying their overconfidence by choosing to go east along the [[Sun Coast]] and round the coastline of the [[Great Sea]] same as the [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March]]. For a year, they cut and slashed their way through untamed wilderness – attacked by monstrous creatures and unknown illnesses against which they had little defense.

Their first significant loss had come with the [[fall of the Oremongers Guild]] back in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. The dozen [[Oremongers Guild#artificer knights|artificer knights]] and their two dozen [[armiger]] squires who the Guild had pledged to this [[House Lightbringer's Questing Charter#The questing party|questing party]] of [[House Lightbringer]] dropped to the ground suddenly. Their bodies were broken and mangled, and their screams echoed throughout the surrounding forests. The warriors amongst the party's ranks found that their blades – to a one forged by the master smiths of the Oremongers Guild – had lost their edges and gone dull.

Their second came as they approached the coastline's bend and hundreds – including Captain Torchbearer herself – fell ill with a deadly fever. Her will is said to have kept her alive for months, but this only slowed their march until her death. By all accounts driven to madness in grief, the Lord did manage to break through and round the coastline and they finally came upon a great tree with bark as dark as the Nyx itself and leaves that appeared as if made of pure gold.

By then the House Lightbringer's forces had been diminished to little over one hundred fighting men and women, and so the party made camp among the gargantuan roots to rest and prepare to signal home. As they explored this potential new home of man, they were met by weak, desperate bat-like creatures who nevertheless attacked them with all their might. The House was victorious but those who sustained injuries quickly became delirious and fell ill, all while the Lord sat alone with his grief.

When the Lord finally left his tent, his men had devolved into the same bat-like creatures they had slaughtered.

Too late, he saw the great tree for what it was. The bark was in fact sickly and gnarled, the leaves not gold but yellow and dying, and the trunk strangled by hideous, barbed strangler vines. He had become a slave to his hunger – that very same that had felled his Captain and trapped him here – and this hunger strangled his very being like the strangler vines that now beckoned and whispered to him. Like any slave, he was shackled here and to this day remains at the foot of the tree as emissary to the Icon of Hunger and leader of the bat-like creatures his men had become.

When aid finally arrived from the City of Gardens via ship to answer their smoke signal, they too were set upon by the creatures. Barely surviving to see home again, they brought with them the Curseplague of Hunger which ravaged the City for years and which remains hidden in back alleys and shuttered plague dens to this day. The ships also brought with them legends of the Lord, now more tree than flesh and wrapped with barbed, black strangler vines.

Such was the second loss of the [[Crisis of Hubris]] that brought about the [[Red Death period]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

> [[House Lightbringer]] were heroes in their time and achieved heights that would not be seen again for centuries. They represented the shared dream of the [[human clans]]: to create a new and prosperous place in this world for humans. Their [[Fallen House|fall]] teaches us to be weary of the [[Red Court|Hunger]], and not to mistake it for the call of righteous destiny.
