The [[Court]] first congregated forty days after the [[Oremongers Guild]] and their [[Oremongers Guild#Earth shapers|earth shapers]] rose the very [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] itself out of the brilliant white [[wol stone]] that lay beneath the gardens. And for forty days after that, the dozens of [[human clans]] clamored and debated and broke out into fights over what shape their republic would take. Clans vying for [[House|Houseship]] and newly formed Houses vying to be named among the first [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the Court.

Houseship meant representation, equal voting power in matters of the Court and in the development of this City of Gardens. But Great Houseship held greater importance, not just power but responsibility. Not simply a [[Lord Representative]]'s say in the present, but an [[Orator]]'s say in shaping the future.

They were to be the best of humanity. Titans of might, industry, and knowledge. Those whose future was thought to be written in the [[Nyx]] above. On this, the fortieth day of the Court's congregation, they were named as follows:

First was [[Clan Wolfstepper]], the first and most noble of the great clans whose [[Silver Wolves]] grasped the light of the [[Silver Moon]] itself. They were humanity's greatest hunters, and had served as silent guardians along the majority of the [[Elven March]]. They were a bridge between the humans and the many beasts of the [[Known World]], and even now – here in the halls of the Court – their ranks could be seen in both their human and wolf forms.

Second was [[House Lightbringer]], named for their closeness to the [[Sun Elves]] and to the [[nyxfire motes]] themselves. Like the Silver Wolves, their [[cland]] heritage was one of solemn responsibility to lead and protect humanity both on the Elven March and in the young City of Gardens. Already, they had taken on the divine charge of the [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March|since-departed]] [[Elven Legion|Legion]] in keeping the [[nyxfire]] flame of the [[Elven Signaltower]], and truthfully they were the closest thing the human clans had to true leaders.

Third was the [[Oremongers Guild]], for what they lacked in history and heritage they made up for in their recent contributions to humanity and their City of Gardens. The Guild's [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]] with the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] raised up the City itself and the great halls these proceedings now took place in. They represented the burgeoning industry of the City but, more than that, their magics seemed to have much promise in combat and in taming the still-wild Known World.

Last was the [[Materialists College]], whose newly discovered field of [[materialist magics]] represented the start of a grand golden age for humanity. Finally, humanity – inheritors of this [[fallen world]] without [[organic magics]] flowing through their veins – saw a future in which it was feasible that they might attain extramundane powers of their own. Already, in the days and months since the [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founding of the City]], the College had come to represent [[Scholars of the City|its many scholars]] and a bright future of human scholarship.

And so such were the four Great Houses. And from their ranks came four Orators. Finally, after centuries and untold generations lived according to chaotic cland politics, humanity's Court had taken shape.

The many dozen clans who had not been named this day largely accepted these results. To be sure, few others could claim to hold power and influence on par with these factions. Any grudges and spite that _had_ been sown would soon fade over the course of the [[Later Heliotropic Age]], and truth be told few others would have wanted the honor if they had known the great responsibilities that lay ahead for these four.

No representatives of the [[Rookish clans]] were named or granted Great Houseship. With the splitting off of the [[Fisher Queens]] and later the [[Messengers Guild]] and the fragmentation of the Rooks that followed, their political prospects greatly. In truth, their [[Rookish clans#Raptor eyes|much-suffering eyes]] had been the subject of rumor and superstition for so many generations born and dead along the Elven March that the clans of the young City were far too wary to grant them this kind of power over them.
