## Perceived reality

### Psionic imprinting

Psionic imprinting describes the processes by which the Prime Material Sphere and the Psionic Sphere intersect with and influence each other, especially by which phenomena in the latter can manifest in the former.

As an extra-physical Sphere separate from the Prime Material Sphere, the Psionic Sphere presents as a separate-but-overlapping reality. Though many extra-physical Spheres manifest phenomena from the Prime Material Sphere to some extent – most commonly appearing as an extension of the area surrounding the point of access – the Psionic Sphere is a complete perceived reality, manifesting all that is perceived by those on the Prime Material Sphere, Orior or beast. In this way, the Prime Material Sphere has significant influence over the Psionic Sphere.

Conversely, the latter also has influence in the former through the Minds of the perceivers. Perceived reality can lend real psionic power to Objects, Places, and even Words in the Prime Material Sphere, power that manifests through its influence on the actions of the perceivers.

## Traversing the Psionic Sphere

### Kingdom of Memory

### Dwaal, the Dreaming State

There exists a kingdom of dreams in the Psionic Sphere, known as the Dwaal. Those who are proficient in entering the Dwaal and traversing the dreams of those around them – a field of mystic psionics pioneered by the Disciples of the Pretender during the Later Crisis of Hubris – are known as Dwaalsteppers.

Both byproduct of and window into the greater Mind, analysis of the Dwaal is commonly used to address psychological issues and combat the emergence of psychosis – traditionally the work of the Pretender's Psiknights and later the agents of the Psionics College.

## Objects and places of psionic power

Generally, Objects and Places of Psionic Power influence the Prime Material Sphere through the actions of its peoples and beasts. These are easily identifiable by those psions able to traverse the Psionic Sphere, but may range from indetectable to captivating for all others.

Naturally-occurring Objects of Psionic Power are far and few between, but are often docetic in nature – like the psicrystal which is coveted by the agents of the Psionics College. Organic substances with psionic influence are referred to as psychedelia. Most Places of Psionic Power are sites within the Prime Material Sphere that intersect with the Psionic Sphere, where the two have more influence over each other – such as the Mirages of the Deep Deserts.

These can be created through Psionic Imprinting as well, the apperception of the population leaving a mark within the Psionic Sphere. Many Umbral Aspects generate Places of Power which particularly significant influence, often spreading fear and dismay and darkness to those within the Prime Material Sphere.

### Psychedelia

-   Psionics is the extension of the mind to unlock and consciously control what would otherwise be subconscious processes. The use of psychedelics and most methods of mind alteration have been outlawed from all scholarly pursuits of Psionics and from civilian use since the discovery of Level 3 Psions shortly after the formalized definition of the science itself. Though the medical and recreational use of psychedelics was commonplace at the time, it was agreed that under their influence a high-level Psion could all too easily lose control and cause mass damage in an instant.
-   Shortly after their criminalization, a powerful Psion ingested psychedelic mushrooms and enveloped an entire city in a false reality of his own design, losing himself in the process. In the weeks that followed, he claimed to explore "a Plane tangential to the Prime Material Plane -- one not of objective reality but instead entirely shaped by the perception of those within it." The scholar was quickly designated as the first Level 4 Psion, imprisoned for life in isolation, and made the focal point of a new theory of Psionics. Psionic Plane Theory has since been disproven along with the then prevalent Planar Cosmology model, but the Psionic Plane is still the most widely accepted indicator of a Psion of that level.
-   Nevertheless, the illicit use of psychedelics persists among scholars to this day, just as it does among the civilian population. Many scholars have suffered that same fate for much smaller transgressions, but the credit one would receive for completely redefining the field is too much for some to ignore. Perhaps their inability to prevent such occurrences is what left the Waris Empire has just recently begun lifting restrictions on psychedelics for licensed scholars living in remote areas where they are unlikely to cause undue harm.

### Psicrystal

Colloquially known as psicrystal, this docetic material native to the Psionic Sphere is a hot commodity in the circles of humanity's psions. The material reacts to and in turn interacts with psionic influence, glowing in the presence of powerful psions. It is said they can enhance the psionic influence of those around them, and the most wealthy of the City's psions have spent several fortunes and lifetimes to retrieve and acquire obscene amounts of the psicrystal.

### Mirages of the Deep Deserts

In some of the oldest campaigns between the Elven Legion and the storms of Wild Magic that covered the Known World in Pre-History, the wide open landscapes of the Deep Deserts far to the north were permanently and indescribably altered. Fused together from the sand by magical artillery fire, strange crystalline formations now tower over the already massive dunes. These formations resemble abstract sculptures of pinkish glass, sometimes as tall as mountains, and serve as home to nearly every desert colony.

Here, the membrane between the Prime Material Sphere and the Psionic Sphere is thin. This is rumored to cause little-understood phenomena known as Mirages, brought out of their Mind and made real. Those of the deepest desert communities will live their entire lives in the shadow of the psicrystal formations and are said to possess extraordinary abilities that push the limits of what we understand psionics to be.

## Natives of the Psionic Sphere

### Thoughtform

Thoughtform are manifestations borne of the Psionic Sphere. Where Humans exist in the Physical Sphere and possess psionic traits that manifest a presence in the Psionic Sphere, Thoughtform exist solely in the Psionic Sphere and are only perceived as having a presence in the Physical Sphere.
