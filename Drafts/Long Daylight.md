After proving that the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] could swiftly be vanquished by exposure to the light of [[Ylem]], the scholars of the [[Materialists College]] would propose an unprecedented alteration to the [[Elven Signaltower]] before the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]]. Rather than alternating between day and night as designed by the [[Sun Elves]], they would usher in a period of sustained daylight in order to limit the movements of the enemy in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

As the [[Red Death period]] went on and the threats to the populace of the City increased, the Court would ultimately approve the motion, ushering in a phenomena now known as the Long Daylight. This was highly effective in creating [[Red Death period City of Gardens#Bastions from the Red Court|bastions]] from the soldiers of the Red Court, namely around the Signaltower and in the [[Duchy of Stilts]].

## The Daywatch

[[House of the Sun]] signal keepers who tended to the [[Elven Signaltower]] throughout the Long Daylight came to be called the [[House of the Sun#Daywatch|Daywatch]]. Faced with constant exposure to the divinity of its [[nyxfire]] flame, the Daywatch were subject significant physical, psychological, and spiritual side-effects. Ultimately, it was these signal keepers who unleashed the great and devastating [[Burning]] which brough the [[Red Death period]] to its end.

## Consequences of the Long Daylight

- Effects on the populace
    - Sleeplessness and drowsiness
    - Depression
    - Anxiety and irritability
    - Compromised immune system

Harsh and constant light of [[Ylem]] cast by the [[Elven Signaltower]] and its [[nyxfire]] flame deepened the shadows, creating [[Shades]] in the outskirts of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]. 
- The [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] were able to thrive and multiply
- Significantly more dangerous for the [[Apotropaics]] to enter into [[Red Death period City of Gardens#Enemy territory|enemy territory]]
- This plus the exposure of the [[Burning]] would have side effects for years after the end of the [[Red Death period]]

## The Long Daylight across the Known World

- Led to [[Pilgrims of the Orior|pilgrimages]] of many races of the [[Orior]] to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]
