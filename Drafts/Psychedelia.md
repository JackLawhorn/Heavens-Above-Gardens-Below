# Psychedelia

Psychedelia are drugs that affect the mind and its perception of reality. The rise of psychedelia is inextricably tied to the rise of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]], although it is not known which caused the other. The Disciples transformed entire streets and squares into gardens where both produce and psychedelic flora could be freely picked and consumed.

Those under the influence of psychedelia come dangerously close to bending the [[Laws of Power]], which govern Space and Time. In addition to this great and dangerous [[paradoxy]], psychedelia is known to temporarily enhance and even awaken [[Psionics|psionic]] potential in those who consume them. The [[Renascence]] scholars of the [[Psionics College]] would push these boundaries almost to their breaking point until finally a string of devastating psionic attacks would be unconsciously unleashed on [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] in the [[Later Renascence period]]. All psychedelic substances are now restricted by the [[House of Vice]] as [[Drugs in the City#Highly-Controlled Substances (HCSs)|Highly-Controlled Substances (HCSs)]].
