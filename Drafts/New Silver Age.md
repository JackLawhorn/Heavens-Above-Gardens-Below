The New Silver Age is a [[cults|cult]] formed by the remnants of the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fallen]] [[Silver Wolves]] after their [[Sin of the Silver Wolves|departure]] from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] at the end of the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]]. Formed around a [[#Prophesy of the Luminary|prophesized]] messiah figure known as the [[Luminary]], the New Silver Age saw significant [[#Renascence decline|decline]] throughout the [[Renascence]] and today consists as a loose conglomeration of disparate, ineffectual subsects throughout the [[Known World]].

## History of the New Silver Age

### Prophesy of the Luminary

The prophesy of the [[Luminary]] extends as far back into the history of [[Clan Wolfstepper]] as the forming of their [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]] with the [[Wolf Mother]] along the [[Elven March]]. Before the [[Red Death period]], before the [[Crisis of Hubris]] itself, the Clan had been told by the [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]] herself that her child would be borne of them one day and that this child would lead them, humanity, and all of the [[Known World]] into the future.

The prophesy was passed down through the packs of the Clan and their elders for centuries. In the [[Heliotropic Age]], the prophesy was no secret among the rest of humanity and in truth the [[Silver Wolves]] themselves were already as saviors to the vulnerable [[human clans]]. The human bards, it is thought, would have told stories and sang songs of the Luminary as well as more minor and generally fictional figures.

With the losses of the Crisis of Hubris, however, Clan Wolfstepper became more guarded with the prophesy of their lineage. The devastating [[Fallen Houses|falls]] of each [[Great House]] – and especially the [[Oremongers Guild]], the [[Materialists College]], and the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] – did not heed well for the coming of the Luminary and what a hungry humanity might do. The [[Red Death period]] and the great [[Burning]] that ended it had destroyed all but the oral history of Clan Wolfstepper. The oral history was no longer told or sung of, nor did it enter into the [[House of the Sun]]'s [[Public Record]]. Temples to the Wolf Mother were rebuilt, but were not adorned with the words of the prophesy nor images depicting the Luminary themself.

### Fall of the Silver Wolves

When the [[Red Death period]] came to an end, so too did the [[Red Moon#Unrest among the Lunar Aspects|unrest]] of the[[ Lunar Aspects]] and most notably the [[Wolf Mother]] herself. Her influence in the [[Prime Material Sphere]] was all but lost, wounds inflected over months of heated battle with the [[Red Court]] in [[Red Court#Sphere of the Red Court|their extra-physical Sphere]]. If the [[#prophesy of the Luminary|prophesy]] of the [[Luminary]] was to come to fruition, it would come only years from then.

Sure enough, the [[Silver Wolves]] heard once again from their [[iconic pacts|patron]] [[Aspect]] less than a century later. The child was coming, one who would be borne of the daughter of the [[House of the Sun]]'s [[Orator]] and a son of [[Clan Wolfstepper]]. It was clear that neither protection of nor influence over the Luminary would not fall solely to the Clan. The reception of the other Orator, who would be the maternal grandmother of the child, was also a concern. After all, she had already lost one child who – in quite the cruel coincidence – had also been [[Pretender|purported to be a messiah]].



### The Luminary

> For more, see [[Luminary]].

The [[Luminary]], the [[Moon-Touched]] daughter of the [[Wolf Mother]] herself, is the [[#Prophesy of the Luminary|prophesized]] messiah figure around which the [[cults|cult]] called the New Silver Age was formed.
