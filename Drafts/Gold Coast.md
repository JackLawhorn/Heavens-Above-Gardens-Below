The Gold Coast is the western coast of the [[Old World]] continent, extending northward from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], which has played a role in human history multiple times. First traveled along by the [[Sun Elves]] and [[human clans]] throughout the [[Elven March|Elven March period]]. Later, the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] would travel its length, tracing the steps of the Elven March on their [[Questing Charter of the Pretender|religious pilgrimage]] to the [[Deep Deserts]].
