The western coast of the lands to the north of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], along which the [[Sun Elves]] and [[human clans]] traveled during the [[Elven March|Elven March period]]. Here lies the [[Great Delta]], where humanity had their [[first parley with the elemental motes]].

Later, the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] would travel north along the Gold Coast, tracing the steps of the Elven March on their journey to the [[Deep Deserts]].
