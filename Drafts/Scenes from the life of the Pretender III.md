- Cold opening on a chaotic dinner scene
    - The [[House of the Sun]]'s [[Orator]] is shouting and throwing tableware around the room
    - At the table are...
        - Her biological daughter, just a child and flinching with every crash
        - Her adopted child, a young adult who came into the Orator's household and family some years ago
- Conversation between the two
    - Daughter: "Please mother, I think they've--"
    - Orator: "I know they're still here!" She continues her rampage
    - Daughter: *I'm sorry you have to see her like this... You have no idea the burdens she carries*
    - The Pretender: *I know. It's okay.*
    - Daughter: *What were you arguing about?*
    - The Pretender: (silence)
    - Daughter: *You don't have to tell me. I know you hate it here.*
    - The Pretender: *I don't hate it. Or I didn't.*
    - Daughter: *It wasn't better with the Silver Wolves?*
    - The Pretender: *It was lonelier. They didn't let me go out. And I didn't have a sister.*
    - Daughter: (hides a smile so as not to be found out by her mother)
    - The Pretender: *She said I couldn't see papa anymore.*
    - Daughter: *I'm sorry.* (pause) *Is it true? What they say about him, I mean*
    - The Pretender: *I don't know. He never talked about it. The Silver Wolves thought the same thing though, so I suppose it must be true.*
    - Daughter: *They aren't right about everything you know. Neither is my mother.*
    - The Pretender: *She's right about me. I'm falling behind in my lessons. I haven't been going to my trainings.*
    - Daughter: *You're carrying burdens too.*
    - The Pretender: *Yeah.*
    - Daughter: *Why don't you leave here?*
    - The Pretender: *What do you mean?*
    - Daughter: *I mean why don't you leave here. You could see him. Who could stop you?*
    - The Pretender: *I don't know. I never thought about it. I suppose I've always just gone where I was told I needed to be.* (long pause) *Would you come with me?*
- The Orator seems to gives up, says something clearly exasperated, and leaves
- The Pretender: "Thank you"
- Then the daughter feels their presence leave her mind

- Cut to their mentor, the former materialist scholar, at the gates of the Court
    - Guards are not letting him through
    - He is frustrated, they will not let him see his ward
    - He's creating a bit of a spectacle, and a small number of passersby are sticking around wondering what the commotion is all about
- The revelation of the Pretender
    - The ornately carved stone doors of the Court burst open, and out explodes a frenzy of color and sound and smell unlike anything humanity had every seen before
    - The Pretender waltzes down the steps
    - Guards attempt to apprehend them but are quickly [[psionics#Psionic attack|disabled]] by their powerful [[psionics]]
- Reaction of their mentor
- Such was the [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of the [[Psionic Age]]
