# Infrastructure and layout

---

[[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] was built around the [[Elven Signaltower]], and radiating outward from its base is a great urban layout called the [[rota]], a radial grid of streets. Along main streets, called [[rayas]], are the major political and industrial entities, between which lay more densely packed residential areas. They are wider, with additional lanes to accommodate more vehicles and pedestrian traffic. Territory along the rayas and closer to the Signaltower is highly sought after.

The rota is not a full circle because the Signaltower was built on the [[Sun Coast]]. Its southern sector expands beyond into the [[Sink]] itself, where in the [[Crisis of Hubris]] the [[Fisher Queens]] built up the [[Duchy of Stilts]] suspended above the waves.

## Gardens

The titular gardens of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]], upon which it was first [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founded]], dot the [[rota]] and lend the spaces between the white of its [[wol stone]] an evergreen hue of verdant green. They cover rooftops, span what would otherwise be alleyways and through streets, and fill in almost every gap of usable space.

Maintained by botanists and gardeners and agriculturists of nearly every [[Human clans|clan]] and [[House]], the gardens are places of worship to the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] and to the natural wonders of the [[Known World]]. They serve as a home to a great many races of [[Discoveries in the Known World#Noble beasts|noble beasts]], as well as simple beasts who have come to adapt to the urban environment.

All of the disparate natives of the City do their part to maintain the gardens, and in return they reap herbs and produce and raw materials for various industries. Some are strictly communal while others are proprietary to specific factions, generally those built on or around that faction's territory.
