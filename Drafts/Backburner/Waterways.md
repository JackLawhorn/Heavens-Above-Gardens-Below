# Waterways of the City

---

In many ways, [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] is defined by the water that surrounds and runs through it. To the west, the [[Gold Coast]], down which the [[human clans]] followed the [[Sun Elves]] along the [[Elven March]]. To the south, the [[Sun Coast]] and the [[Great Sea]] that separates this [[Old World|Old World continent]] from the [[Beastlands]] and the rest of the [[Lands to the South]].

The [[New City]] has expanded to grow alongside the Sun Coast, and as of the [[Later Renascence period]] and [[Early Post-Enlightenment Period]], this access to the Great Sea has enabled humanity's exploratory missions and the founding of many of its [[Questing Houses]] and their far off colonies.

Though the City itself runs the roaring [[Torrente]] river, which carries fresh water from a nearby mountain peak to the northeast.
