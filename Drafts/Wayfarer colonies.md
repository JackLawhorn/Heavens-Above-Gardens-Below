## Sovereignty of the colonies

At the time of their founding, the [[Wayfarers Guild]] held little influence in [[Court]], in which each [[House]] holds only a single vote. Just as the [[cland]] peoples had been under persecution by their neighbors, the wayfarer colonies chose total self-sufficiency rather than invite the influence of the Court on their journeys and into their new homes.

With the formation of the [[Republic]] in the [[Later Renascence period]] and now in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], however, each human colony across the [[Known World]] held a vote of its own in matters that impacted more than just [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Under this new system, the [[Guild]] held much power in such matters â€“ their colonies numbering greater than those of the [[Questing Houses]] themselves.

## Intersections in the Known World

Exiled from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[Remnants of the Fallen Houses|remnants]] of the [[Fallen Houses]] that still exist in the wider [[Known World]] often seek refuge or opportunity in the various other human settlements.
