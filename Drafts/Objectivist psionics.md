## Category 0 – Latent psionic influence

- Presence in the [[Psionic Sphere]]
- Those who cannot be awakened

## Category 1 – Awakened mind

### Psionic awakening

- Natural awakenings
    - Only exception is the [[dreaming psions]]
- The [[Disciples of the Pretender]]
- Clients of the [[Agents of the Psionics College#College tutors|College tutors]]

### Enhance senses and body

The simplest of Psionic feats, and the initial indicator of Enlightenment for many Psions, is to sharpen and dull senses at will. The upper echelon of Category 1 Psions are also able to unlock Clarity -- the sixth sense -- to further extend themselves past normal human limits.

More experienced Psions gain more granular control over bodily functions other than sensory perception, unlocking control over processes that are normally subconscious or involuntary. No Psion since the first has achieved this power without scholastic study and directed training.

## Category 2 – Extended mind

### Throw presence

Almost exclusively achieved by scholars at the College, the ability to throw one's presence as one might throw their voice is highly coveted for its rapid communication and espionage capabilities. Category 3 Psions can tether their senses to an anchor -- another person or a sufficiently intelligent beast such as a familiar. Only Psions of Category 4 and above are prepared with mental countermeasures against being tethered in this way.

### Psionic subversion

#### Suggestion

#### Attention and recognition

#### Hallucination

### Psionic assault and defense

Category 2 Psions are able to lash out with powerful Psionic assaults or defend against such attacks. These Psions have cultivated a fearsome reputation as warriors and spies who hijack an enemy's senses and drill into their mind to uncover the secrets within, often serving the highest bidder if not the shadowy agenda of the College. Every House and Great Family will doubtless have in their employ Category 4 Psions serving as spies, investigators, and protectors. One common service they provide is powerful mental defense mechanisms.

- Messengers of the [[Psionic Telecommunication Network]]

## Category 3 – Consuming mind

### Sharemind

- Psionic imprinting

### Psionic traversal

- Realms within the [[Psionic Sphere]]
    - [[Kingdom of Memory]]

#### Dwaalstepping

### Psionic Plane Magic

Complete mastery of Psionic assault on the senses begins to resemble near god-like power, allowing Category 5 Psions to reshape perceived reality around them. These powerful individuals can't change the physical reality, instead altering how it is perceived by all those around them with impossibly perfect and often undetectable finesse. Few Category 5 Psions are known to have ever existed, but they are prized as near invulnerable warriors in combat and watched with strict scrutiny by anyone with any amount of sense.

## Category 4 – ???

### Bestow Presence

The existence of Category 6 Psionic abilities is hotly debated in scholarly circles both in and out of the College. In fact, the only suspected Psion of this level throughout history was the very first who, during his messianic effort to lead his people to a paradise of his own design, is said to have granted sentience and consciousness to a troop of mushrooms along their path. Hundreds of years later, some still claim that this legend is the true origin of the powerful Psionic mushroom horde known as the Gljiva.

### Manifestation
