## The Materialists College

> For more, see [[Materialists College]].

The first [[college]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and named as one of the original [[Great House|Great Houses]] of its [[Court]], the [[Materialists College]] stewarded the founding and growth of the [[Scholars Quarter]] itself.

The first [[Materialist magics|materialists]] came from the [[cland]] botanists and herbalists and took a more mystic approach to their field. After [[#the Schism|Schism]], the College fell in line with the [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivists]] they themselves are remembered alongside today. From that point on, they would hold a contentious relationship with certain [[Scholars of the City#Subjectivist factions|Subjectivist factions]], but generally did not engage in the politics of the time.

The Materialists College led and represent the many [[scholars of the City]] and were largely responsible for the proliferation of humanity's scholarly endeavors. Though they guided the colleges and factions of the Quarter, they wielded their political power in Court selectively, conservatively, and primarily to forward their own agenda: the development of human scholarship and scholarly endeavors both of their own and led by the other scholars of the City.

After the [[Red Death period]], the Materialists College quietly receded from the public eye, including their responsibilities within the Scholars Quarter. Only years later, it would be revealed that they had been preoccupied with dark experiments that ultimately led to their [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]].

## The Schism

In the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]], the [[Scholars Quarter]] became embroiled in what would come to be called the *Schism*. Today, over two [[Ages of the Known World|ages]] later, this conflict of the minds is remembered as the origin of concepts of [[the Objective]], [[the Subjective]], and many of the [[College|colleges]] and factions which purport to explore world through either perspective.

- Defining of [[the Objective]] and [[the Subjective]]
- [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivists]] versus [[Scholars of the City#Subjectivists|Subjectivists]]
    - The [[Cult of Pythos]] versus the [[Philosophers Guild]]

## Psionics College

> For more, see [[Psionics College]].

After the [[fall of the Materialists College|fall]] of the [[Materialists College]], the [[Scholars Quarter]] was largely without leadership and without greater representation in matters of the [[Court]]. Things would stay this way until the rise to prominence of the [[Psionics College]] in the [[Early Renascence period]].
