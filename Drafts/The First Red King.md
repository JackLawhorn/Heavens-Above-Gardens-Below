Four months after departing from the [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|newly-founded]] [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]], the [[Sun Elves]] have rounded the shore of the [[Great Sea]] and now follow the [[Black Coast]] along their [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March|Post-Heliotropic March]]. There is a great and beautiful tree there, whose [[extramundane]] growth within the [[nyxfire]] storms of the [[Wild Magics]] has led it to become a massive landmark and natural wonder of the [[Known World]].

Among their ranks is Lux, a [[Griot]] of the [[Griot#Orders|Second Order]]. One night, they consult the wisdom of the [[Nyx]] and find themselves called to rise up a people – a potential race of the [[Orior]] – who call the great tree their home. Speaking to her comrades about this calling, it is agreed that the March has been slowed enough already by their former companions the humans. Determined still to complete this divinely ordained quest, Lux resolves to breaks off from their people and plans to reunite with them after spreading the [[Elven Tongue]] and their divine and secret knowledge to this founding race.

It takes Lux only a day to journey from the shore of the Black Coast where the [[Elven Legion|Legion]] had made camp to the understory below the great tree. Arriving as dusk falls, they look up and are in awe to find that what appears to be a massive cloud is descending from the canopy. Looking closer, they are shocked to see that this cloud is in fact comprised of what must be millions of creatures. They are possessed of large wings that allow sustained flight, unique among the races of the Orior for even the [[Storm Elves]] make use of their [[cloudcraft]].

A beautiful [[Nycter#Communication|song]] is carried down on the wind as the cloud changes course to meet Lux on the ground below. At first, the scene is chaos. Quickly, however, their attempts to communicate evolve from high-pitch screeches to the universal tongue of the Elves. As with the humans and every race on ever world before them, this came as a shock to the people who called themselves the [[Nycter]], but they quickly adapted and wished to know all the wisdom that this noble stranger had to offer on this world and the wider Nyx.

Lux found the Nycter beautiful and fascinating. Covered in fur and speaking from elongated snouts, they most closely resembled the wolves and foxes of this world. They possessed only poor and underdeveloped eyesight, but their powerful ears enabled them to "see" the world around them through the sounds and echoes of their songs. Furthermore, they held a close and protective relationship with the natural world around them: their cloud of millions called the canopy above their home, leaving their roosts every night to pollinate the plants here and promote verdant growth.

When conversation turned to their acts of worship, however, Lux began to grow concerned. According to the Nycter, all who lived here were under the patronage of an [[Aspect]] of the Night, Nox, who lived nearby in the roots of the great tree. By all accounts, this Nox had been a kind and fair patron who tended to the needs of this place and those who called it home. Hearing this, Lux knew the truth: Nox was a pretender, likely born of the Wild Magics, as the Night is the domain of the Nyx and the Nyx alone.

In the morning, they set out towards the trunk of the great tree and, once there, ventured into the tunnels of its root system ready to confront this pretender. Deep within this place, in the dark tunnels far from the light of day, they finally came upon a great chamber where were surprised to see not an Aspect of [[Ylem]] at all but a curious creature who appeared almost as a reflection of Lux themself. The creature, who appeared to be similarly surprised, introduced himself.

"Hail stranger and well met," he said. "I am Nox. I must confess that I have never seen one of your kind. What brings you to this place?"

"I am Lux," they responded without quite matching his pleasantries, "Griot of the Second Order and Sun Elf of the Legion. I happened upon this place by chance, and had hoped to meet the Aspect who calls themselves by your name. But I can see you are no Aspect of Ylem, what manner of thing are you?"

"Ah, an Elf of the Legion. So it is your tongue with which they spoke. I never claimed to be an Aspect, perhaps you have no better word for what I am. But I *have* sought to be as a patron to this place and its people. I am an inheritor of the [[Old World]], the last of my people if I had to guess. You may not have a word for us, but in our day we called ourselves *[[Verdigris]]*."

This elicited a dramatic response from Lux, who pulled their spear and summoned their flames. "*Verdigris*? Surely you mean *Dark Elf*, child of the [[Dragon]]."

Lunging into battle without another word, the Sun Elf summoned every bit of their strength and made each strike with the intent to kill this natural enemy of their people. Though this Nox was unarmed, he was not felled by the first blow nor the second, and in fact returned their extramundane combat prowess in kind.

"I have known no Dragon, nor have I heard this name that you call me with such spite," he responded calmly while dodging fatal blow after fatal blow. "What, may I ask, have I done to warrant such lively assault?"

"Whatever evil you are doubtlessly perpetrating here is more than enough to warrant wetting my arm with your black blood," Lux replied.

"You must draw my blood then," their strange enemy sang, "and see that it is not black but green." After a pause he continued: "Are you not a Griot of the Second Order? Was it not the guidance of the Nyx itself who brought you here to me? Did the stars warn of an enemy or could they have not sent you to a new ally?"
