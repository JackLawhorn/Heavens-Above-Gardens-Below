The Isle of Melos is the oldest surviving human settlement outside of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], founded by the [[Fall of the Materialists College#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exiled]] [[necromancer demons]] of the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fallen]] [[Materialists College]]. 

## History of the Isle of Melos

## Colony of the necromancer demons

### Dukes of Melos

### Unholy Reliquaries

High upon the hill and far from the docks where respectable trade takes place, the Isle of Melos houses four structures, known as the Unholy Reliquaries, in which raw materials are stored and preserved for the macabre experiments of the [[necromancer demons]]:
- The Ossuarium is bones
- The Sanguinarium is blood
- The Spoliarium. is flesh
- A fourth for coats, furs, and skins?

## Production and export

The Isle of Melos exports a significant amount of [[docetic materials#brimstone (sulfur)|brimstone]] and other [[alchemy|alchemical]] ingredients and byproducts. Surprisingly, however, these do not constitute the majority of its exports. The Isle is also rich in a wide variety of natural resources and agriculture is a significant source of income. Oranges, olives, cypress, tamarisk and juniper trees all grow natively, and its volcanic soil readily welcomes profitable crops such as cotton and barley.

### Trade and diplomacy

The magics of the [[necromancer demons]] also readily produce [[demonic]] artifacts, granting them powerful, [[extramundane]] abilities and allowing them to become some of the [[Known World]]'s foremost power brokers. Though still under strict [[Fall of the Materialists College#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exile]] by the [[Court]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] of the [[Questing Houses]] are under only the most minor of obligations to uphold the [[Law and justice in the City|laws of the City]].

The [[Blackpowder Guild]] and the rest of the [[Engineers Union]] are common collaborators with the demons of Melos, as well as most of the other island colonies dotting the [[Great Sea]] who depend on trade with Melos. It's closest neighbor is [[House Talos]] and its garden of [[simulacra]].
