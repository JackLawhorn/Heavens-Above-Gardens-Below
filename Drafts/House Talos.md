## History of House Talos

### Origins in the Vergonic Movements

The founder of [[House Talos]] was a sculptor of the [[Mouseion]]. At a meeting of the [[First Vergonic Church]], they met a fellow member from the [[Horologists Guild]] – a [[House of Industry]] founded in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and so old that they had seen a great decline in prominence despite the ubiquity of their timekeepers in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. True to the [[Politics of the Scholars Quarter#The Vergonic Movements|Vergonic Movement]], they entered into a lively discussion on the clockwork mechanisms that powered their new companion's work.

Later in their life, when the first sparks of the [[Vergonic War]] were ignited and aspersions were starting to be cast on remnants of the First Vergonic Church, the founder would call on favors and allegiances to flee the City. They would go on to found the [[Isle of Talos]], one of the first colonies settled on the [[Isles of the Great Sea|isles]] of the [[Great Sea]].

### Invention and development of simulacra

Once settled on the [[Isle of Talos]], the founder – remembering a companion he had met in the [[First Vergonic Church]] – began to experiment with sculptures with hidden clockwork mechanisms that allowed them to be animated. Surprisingly, one of these prototypes briefly manifesting attributes of [[near-life]] before laying still once more. Over the next centuries, the founder and their descendants would continue to develop these prototypes: what they called [[simulacra]] of life.

This achievement was long kept secret until the [[House]]'s remote island colony was populated by whole cultures of simulacra. This technology would of course be shared with the rest of humanity, but first spread throughout the [[colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] of the [[Questing Houses]] in an attempt by the [[Engineers Union]] to cultivate political power and relative independence from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Court]]. Now they are a common sight throughout the streets and [[rayas]] of the City, in every major [[House]], and in the homes of their [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]].
