### Departure from the City

    - Fled during the [[Vergonic War]]
- Founded the [[Isle of Talos]]
    - One of the first colonies settled on the [[Isles of the Great Sea|isles]] of the [[Great Sea]]

### Invention and development of Simulacra

This technology would of course be shared with the rest of humanity, but first spread throughout the [[colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] of the [[Questing Houses]] in an attempt by the [[Engineers Union]] to cultivate political power and relative independence from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Court]]. Now they are a common sight throughout the streets and [[rayas]] of the City, in every major [[House]], and in the homes of their [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]].
