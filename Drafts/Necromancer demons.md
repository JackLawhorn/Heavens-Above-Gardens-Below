## Quests of the demons

### Hunt for the Red King

## Tools of the demons

## Classes of demons

### Necroscholars

Necroscholars dissect and experiment on the corpses of the Orior and the Noble Beasts, quantifying the organic magics they possessed in life, the materialist magics of their remains in death, and the ease with which this power can be levied by the many Demons and Devils of their ranks.

### Necromancer demons

Necromancer Demons stalk prey throughout the Known World; most notably the Red King himself. In the Post-Enlightenment Era, their death squads are armed with both powerful necromancy and other materialist magics, as well as the deadly firearms purchased from the Blackpowder Guild.

### Necromancer devils

Devils are Necromancers of great power, distinguished from their Demon brethren by their great will and sacrifice in the pursuit of greater magics. Their Forms are monstrous, enhanced by often fatal grafts taken from other creatures. In return, they have become forces of nature just as much as they are the product of dangerous and immoral techno-magical advancement.

### Necromancer Archdevils

The Archdevils are Necromancer Devils elevated to the power of the Ylem themselves, bathed in blood and battle-tested. Often warped by multiple magical grafts, the Archdevils ascend by destroying a Minor Aspect in one-on-one combat and – in doing so – become Umbral Aspects themselves. The meager ranks of these horrific warrior scholars are the closest thing the Demons have to real leadership.
