## Magical forces as sources of power

Knowing I wanted humans to be the most prominent race in this setting, I wanted to explore what the experience of a people without magics of their own would look like. With every other race of the [[Orior]] having what I've called "[[organic magics]]" or magics they are born with and can naturally access, how would humans attempt to obtain power of their own?

First, as a consequence of organic magics, I imagined a class of "[[Materialist magics]]" or those that remain in the biological matter of magical peoples. The idea of trinkets and artifacts being created from these remains is very interesting to me, and the extremes of this idea even more so. I will eventually get to the [[Necromancer Demons]] of the [[Materialists College]] and their death squads.

Secondly, in a world in which [[Pact magics|pact magic]] exists, it seemed clear to me that humans would jump to take advantage of this "shortcut" to attaining power. With the warlocks or "iconic mages" of this setting so ready and willing to take on pacts, how can I explore the mechanics of this process and the motives behind different patrons? Some, like the [[Lunar Aspects#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]], are benevolent and offer favorable terms to their worshippers. Others may not be so kind, and the cost of the pacts they dole out might be great.

Lastly, where lays the line between magic and mundane ability honed to its sharpest? Surely, a people like the humans in this setting would be intrigued by anything discovered to be close to magic but achievable through solely human means. What human abilities are close enough to magic so as to be extendable to an entire magic system? The [[psionics]] of this setting will definitely explore that.

## Real world sources of power

What non-magical or real-world sources of power can be explored, especially in the urban fantasy setting of a single metropolitan city like [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]? I hope to explore:

- Politics and various socio-political currency
- Production and who control over it naturally lies with
- Control of territory in a relatively limited area
- Religious and philosophical power and how it spreads through the populace
- Scholarship and the power of history and the arts
- Expansion and exploration and how a people spread outward from a population center
- Colonialism and diaspora
- The role that immigrants play in any society
- The role that animals and hypothetical non-human inhabitants play
