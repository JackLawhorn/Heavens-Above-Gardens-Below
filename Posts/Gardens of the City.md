The titular gardens of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]], upon which it was first [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founded]], dot the [[rota]] and lend the spaces between the white of its [[wol stone]] an evergreen hue of verdant green. They cover rooftops, span what would otherwise be alleyways and through streets, and fill in almost every gap of usable space.

All of the disparate natives of the City do their part to maintain the gardens, and in return they reap herbs and produce and raw materials for various industries. Some are strictly communal while others are proprietary to specific factions, generally those built on or around that faction's territory.

## Inhabitants of the gardens

Taking up approximately one third of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s area, its titular gardens serve as a home to a great many races of [[noble beasts]], as well as simple beasts who have come to adapt to the urban environment. The former are often [[Mutualist pacts|mutualist companions]] to a [[House]] or [[human clans|clan]] who serve these spaces as gardeners, herbalists, botanists, or agriculturists. The latter are afforded safe haven in these spaces as their presence alone often works to promote verdancy and growth here.

The most common noble beasts of the gardens are the flocks of the [[Rookish clans]], who play a key role in pollinating flora and in carrying seeds long distances. Many of the rookish [[roccas]] are positioned adjacent to or within close distance to many different gardens.

More recently, the [[Procyon gaze]] have taken to the gardens of the City, though their detractors among the populace do not approve of their use of them as living spaces or their predilection towards stealing produce.

## Gardener classes of the City

### Cland herbalists and botanists

The first tenders to the gardens of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] were the herbalists of the [[human clans]] and the botanists who came after them. From these gardens, the herbalists and botanists yielded the raw materials needed for their floral and herbal balms, potions, and other concoctions. With these they went out into the streets and [[rayas]] of the City selling their wares and services as healers of all kinds of ailments.

Since the [[Later Heliotropic Age]], the classes of gardeners have exploded into a wide range of gardeners and agriculturists of nearly every [[Human clans|clan]] and [[House]], and especially the [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] and the [[Houses of Industry]]. With the [[decline of cland culture]], these original gardeners have become a rare sight in these spaces, with many moved away to the [[Wayfarer colonies]].

### The Agisters Guild

> For more, see [[Agisters Guild]].

The naturalists of the [[Agisters Guild]], who prefer the familiarity of the forests to the cramped urban sprawl of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], tend to trees and bring back new species of flora from their excursions outside the City walls. Their noble [[Mutualist pacts|mutualist companions]] call these gardens home when not in service to the [[Agisters Guild#stag knights|stag knights]].

Certain trees as prized more than others, especially by the City's highest social classes, and the Guild was able to cement themselves as a powerful [[Houses of Industry|House of Industry]] by making available new and exotic species from faraway forests and their own nurseries. Flowering trees and those that bare luxurious fruits are of particularly high demand.

### The Apiarians Guild

> For more, see [[Apiarians Guild]].

The swarms of the [[Apiarians Guild]]'s companions serve a vital role in pollinating the flora of the gardens and have grown to prominence as a [[Houses of Industry|House of Industry]] through their wildly popular honeys which they can be found selling up and down the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s [[rayas]]. In addition to promoting verdancy and growth, the swarms of bees serve as a protective measure against predators who would make a home for themselves in these spaces and against any thieves foolish enough to steal from their neighbors.

### The Undergardeners

> For more, see [[Undergardeners]].

Primarily tending to [[the Maw]], the [[Undergardeners]] are almost entirely comprised of the surviving members of the [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fallen]] [[Oremongers Guild]] and their descendants. Themselves scarred and their bloodlines forever marked as [[Warlock|warlocks]] who broke their [[Pact magics|pact]] with the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]], this service is their penance. An important and respected charge, this work has helped them to avoid the public scrutiny faced by several of the other [[Fallen Houses]].

## Role of the gardens in the City

Practically, the role of the gardens are to produce a truly enormous amount of fruits and vegetables, herbs and petals and seeds, dyes and honeys and wood. The exacting record keepers of the [[House of the Sun]] of the [[Office of the Orator]] have long has long claimed that the gardens yield sufficient produce to feed half of the human population without need for other nutritional sources as may be the case in a disaster such as the [[Red Death period]].

Their more important purpose, however, are as places of worship to the [[Mundial Aspects]] and to the natural wonders of the [[Known World]]. It was the [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|since-fallen]] [[Oremongers Guild]] who first interfaced with the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] and learned that to promote verdancy and growth within the soil itself was as an act of worship. Since then, gardens have largely been plotted and utilized with such a purpose in mind. For example, the leaves of the trees give voice to the [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind motes]] and so they are chosen for the quality of their canopies. Similarly, the closeness and intersectionality between the gardens and the river [[Torrente]] maximalizes the [[iconic pacts|iconic]] significance of these spaces.
