It is only weeks after the great and terrible [[Burning]] that was called down upon [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] to end the [[Red Death period]] and the threat of the [[Red Court]], and the City's shelters and orphanariums are overflowing with the displaced. The other day, those surveying the destruction stood before the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]] and testified that approximately forty percent of the [[rota]] was incinerated in the devastation. [[Reconstruction]] is expected to last years if not decades.

A scholar of the [[Materialists College]] walks down the [[rayas|raya]], far from the [[Scholars Quarter]] and his peers. Each step is accompanied by the *thock* of his staff meeting stone and the tinkling of a belt of trinkets and bobbles holding minor enchantments and other [[extramundane]] properties. His scholar's vestments are worn and tattered after some weeks of wear, but the [[labrum]] of his patron [[Great House]] can still be made out. That mark used to reassure the people of this City. Not anymore.

He passes by children – broken, sickly, and crying – but has little to offer them for he, like the rest of their people, has lost more than he even knew he had. As he arrives to his destination, a shelter no different from any other he passed, he remarks that the child he's come to see – little more than a perfect stranger – is perhaps all he has left.

The proprietor of this place acknowledges his arrival and walks with him briefly. This is not the first time the man has come and he knows the way, but as always the proprietor feels the need to comment on the child. He says they are a [[weirdling]] child, that they are unnatural. They have not been known to talk or sleep or even to eat. The other children do not approach them except to pocket their daily rations or to offer the odd beating. But even the beatings have stopped. Bullies thrive off the attention after all, and what good is a victim who will not beg or fight back or even defend themselves?

Mercifully, he busies himself elsewhere as the man approaches his destination. It would seem the other children are not the only ones who are uncomfortable in their presence. Funny, the man had never been much bothered himself. He was a scholar, after all, and had never been prone to superstition.

At the end of the hall, a young child – unhealthily slim and covered in a fine layer of dirt and grime – sits on their cot with knees up and their face buried. They are alone now, even as the other children can be heard playing outside, finding some semblance of normalcy among the rubble. No friends. No parents or kin of any kind. He can relate to that, thought the man.

As he approaches, the child looks up, revealing sunken eyes that glint briefly. They spring from the cot and wrap their arms around him. The man noted that they are too slim, too light for the pressure to even register. He must be careful not to hurt them. Even this moment was not safe from tragedy.

They have never spoken, but the man has. He has asked all the questions he could think to ask, has told all the stories he could think to tell. And that has created something resembling a relationship with the child. A presence in their life that is not accompanied by pain, nor is it characterized by love that could mean pain to come. For the man, this child was the one good thing about [[The night of the Burning|that night]]. One thing he was able to save.

When the child pulls away at last, there are tears running down the scholar's face. He hadn't meant to betray his vulnerability in front of them.

"I don't suppose you care to talk about how things are going here?" he asked. But already the glint is gone from the child's eyes as they sit back down on the cot. "I didn't think so... Well, no matter. I brought something for you. Here."

He hands them what looks like a mundane stick. In the child's hand, however, it feels alien. It's petrified, hard as stone. Suddenly, they feel a strength surge through them, a warmth that had been missing. Missing since whatever life they had before that night. They still could not recall.

Their stomach growls, and reminds the child of an appetite they didn't know they had. The man is happy to see that the [[Materialist magics|materialist]] trinket has had an effect

"See? I thought that might help." Reaching into his pack, he pulls out a handful of bread and passes it to the child who eyes it briefly before devouring it like a wild animal. "That's quite an appetite! Hold onto that and the rations they give you will hopefully seem a bit more appetizing."

Some time later – after the bread was gone and questions had been asked and the stories had been told – the man stands up to leave.

"I'll be back," he says, "by week's end at the latest. Remember to hold onto what I gave you."

He's four strides away when he hears a faint voice say, "*wait...*" Only it's strange. "Hears" isn't quite the right word. Not quite the right sensation. The child? They haven't spoken in weeks, he's never even heard them speak.

He turns back and – this time looking directly at the child – "hears" once again, *please...* Only their mouth doesn't move to form the word. Four strides away and the voice is as clear as though spoken much closer.

The child looks up at him directly and, with a glint in their eyes, once more says without saying...

*Please... Take me with you*.
