## Origin of the Red Death

A complex and much-debated subject of study, the origins of the [[Red Death]] were eventually found to be a powerful [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] known only as the [[Red Court]]. This [[Aspect]], characterized by an insatiable Hunger, forced [[iconic pacts]] upon its victims that transformed them into vectors for its accursed plague among other horrific effects.

The Red Court itself was first encountered by the [[Quest|questing party]] of [[House Lightbringer]] at the base of the great [[Nyxblight Tree]] far to the east of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Having already afflicted a now sickly and weak race of [[Orior]] – the [[Nycter]] – the plague was now able to make its first jump to human physiology.

## Arrival in Omphalos, the City of Gardens

The [[Red Death]] arrived in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] by boat, the fruit of the young [[Shipwrights Guild]] and their labors. Having traveled east along the [[Sun Coast]] to the base of the great [[Nyxblight Tree]] where a smoke signal promised they would find the survivors of [[House Lightbringer]] and their [[Quest|questing party]], they instead encountered horrors beyond any in human history: the victims of the [[Red Court]].

When their ship returned to the waters outside the City, its crew was all but gone and the Guild resorted to towing it back into the port of the [[Barony of Stilts]]. There were no crew on board, not even signs of a struggle, but that night something did escape from its dark hold and into the City.

## Spread throughout the City

Spread of the [[Red Death]] throughout [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] was rapid. The morning following the return of the [[Shipwrights Guild]]'s ship, agents of the [[Jurisweard]] began receiving reports of disappearances and sightings of strange beasts lurking in the shadows. Reports traced a distinct line from the [[Barony of Stilts#Shipwrights Quarter|Shipwrights Quarter]] in the [[Barony of Stilts|Stilts]] to the City's outer walls.

Two days after that and [[Red Court]] and their plague were entrenched in the outer reaches of what is now the [[Old City]]. An estimated 25 percent of the Jurisweard's ranks had been slain, and disappearances now numbered in the thousands. No remains of the victims had yet been found, but first-hand reports described horrors, predators that ambushed and consumed their prey.

### Evacuations and quarantine

The [[Great House|Great Houses]] declared a state of emergency and began evacuating the affected neighborhoods. Exploring these areas during the day, patrols began finding growths of a black, thorny vine rising up out of the foundation of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]].

Five days after its arrival, symptoms of the [[Red Death]] itself began to appear among those who had been evacuated. As the rest of the populace continued to evacuate further and further into the heart of the City and closer to the light of the [[Elven Signaltower]] and its [[nyxfire]] flame – now altered to illuminate the City throughout the night as well as during the day – the infected were left behind and plague dens left to grow. Each den would be found completely empty one week after being boarded up, more growths of [[Nyxblight]] vines left behind. Still, no corpses or even a single drop of blood left behind.

### Containment

Two months after its arrival, with an estimated 25 percent of the population unaccounted for, the [[Red Court]] began to show itself and engage in active warfare against humanity in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Now showing themselves, the many [[scholars of the City]] and the warrior classes of the [[Jurisweard]] worked to find weaknesses to an enemy that they had so far failed to forge a single victory against.

They were found by the scholars of the [[Materialists College]] to fear the light and combusted when exposed to it. This enabled the containment of the Red Court and its [[Red Death|plague]] within what is now the [[Red Quarter]]. Though this effectively paused the spread of the plague itself among the populace, the war against these horrors would continue for many months.
