The House in the Sun is the fifth [[Great House]] of the [[Court]]. Branching off from the [[Fall of House Lightbringer|since-fallen]] [[House Lightbringer]] upon their departure from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] on their infamous [[Quest into Oblivion]], it was originally [[House Lightbringer's Questing Charter#The House of the Sun|founded]] to represent and extend [[House|Houseship]] to the [[#Keepers of the Elven Signaltower|keepers]] of the [[Elven Signaltower]] and its [[nyxfire]] flame.

Since the [[Red Death period]], it has seen a dramatic rise in prominence and now also serve as humanity's [[#lorekeepers]] and [[#Stewards of the state religion|stewards]] of the City's [[state religion]]. As of the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of the [[Silver Wolves]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], the House of the Sun is sole remaining Great House of humanity.

## Fifth Great House of the Court

The House of the Sun is the fifth [[Great House]] of the [[Court]] and the first to be named after the [[Naming of the Great Houses|original four Great Houses]]. Despite being inserted into this lofty station – taking the place of [[House Lightbringer]] – upon their founding in the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]], they were a relatively passive political entity for years.

Forced to play a prominent role throughout the [[Red Death period]], especially as the engineers of both the [[Long Daylight]] and the [[Burning]], they ultimately became one of the primary agents of leadership and change in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. With each newly [[Fallen Houses|fallen]] Great House of the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], they gained more power in Court and in human society at large.

As of the [[fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of the [[Silver Wolves]] and the [[Renascence period]] that it ushered in, the House of the Sun is the sole remaining Great House, and its [[Orator]] the sole remaining Orator. Now, in the early days of the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], the many [[House|Houses]] of the Court are vying to gain Great Houseship – the first since the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]].

### The Orator

After the [[Crisis of Hubris]], with the House of the Sun serving as the sole remaining [[Great House]] of the [[Court]], the role and responsibilities of the [[Orator]] underwent significant changes. In [[Ages of the Known World|ages]] past, the Orators of each of the Great Houses held equal say in judicating matters of the Court, but now a single Orator held significantly more sway over the past, present, and future of humanity within [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

Their station expanded just as the House of the Sun's own station did, and the [[Office of the Orator]] was ultimately founded to support and facilitate each of these pillars of the Orator's station. Throughout the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and the [[Renascence period]], those rising through the ranks of the House of the Sun with an eye on the station of Orator typically accentuated a focus on either the [[Public Record]], their House's [[state religion]], or various other platforms, with the political relevance of tending to the [[Elven Signaltower]] diminishing over time.

## Keepers of the Elven Signaltower

The House of the Sun was originally [[House Lightbringer's Questing Charter#The House of the Sun|founded]] to represent and extend [[House|Houseship]] to the [[#Keepers of the Elven Signaltower|keepers]] of the [[Elven Signaltower]] and its [[nyxfire]] flame, branching off from their predecessors in [[House Lightbringer]]. For years, this was the only station with which the [[Great House]] preoccupied themselves, and otherwise held very little prominence in the politics of the [[Court]] or society in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

The light of the Signaltower is ever-burning, but is shaped and directed by a number of bronze mechanisms that govern day and night across the [[Known World]]. Its keepers manage these in shifts, led by more senior Watch Captains. The most famous – or perhaps infamous – class of these keepers are the [[#Daywatch]] who arose during the [[Red Death period]].

### Daywatch

This station was most prominent throughout the [[Red Death period]] when the [[Elven Signaltower]]'s light was humanity's most effective weapon and deterrent against the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]]. During that time, the keepers of the light – who came to be known as the Daywatch – were particularly significant players in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and were the engineers of both the [[Long Daylight]] and the [[Burning]].

Suffering through extended exposure to the [[nyxfire]] flames and the divine influence of the [[nyxfire motes]] who lived within it, the Daywatch endured significant physical and psychological side effects, as well as hallucinatory visions they attributed to the will of [[Ylem]]. Their descendants would go on to serve as leaders of worship for humanity, aligning with the House of the Sun's [[state religion]] and later the [[New Vergonic Movement]].

## Lorekeepers

Taking responsibility for the losses of the [[Burning]], the House of the Sun and its [[Orator]] stood before the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]] and pledged to shoulder a new burden: serving as humanity's lorekeepers similar to the [[Griot|Griots]] of the [[Elven Legion]]. Now, they ensure that human history is recorded and will survive into perpetuity, and that the destruction of historical record during the [[Red Death period]] will not be repeated.

To accomplish this, the House of the Sun created the [[Public Record]], a massive historical archive into which all goings on in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] are recorded. Within its halls stands the [[Hall of Precedent]] – which records all matters of the Court – and the [[Public Scholarship|Hall of Public Scholarship]] – which makes available all human scholarly materials under Public Scholarship Law.

As its name implies, all of the Public Record is freely accessible by the City's populace. Even in the dead of night, it is rare not to see scholars and other visitors perusing its halls and the archives they hold. House of the Sun lorekeepers serve dual roles as archivists and investigative librarians, and [[#House of the Sun Aides]] scurry about couriering records between the archives and inquisitive patrons.

### House of the Sun Aides

House of the Sun Aides serve a wide breadth of roles within the [[Great House]], and most who hold higher stations start as Aides themselves. The vast majority of them serve on the cabinets of the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]], working with their [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] to record and archive the goings on  of each House. Others work exclusively within the halls of the [[Public Record]], attend all matters of the Court as scribes, or work with the [[scholars of the City|scholars]] within the [[Scholars Quarter]] and its many [[College|colleges]].

Aides within the [[Office of the Orator]] are particularly busy, and may be promoted to the rank of Famulus to work directly with the [[Orator]] themselves. The Famuli recover and courier obscure texts requested by the Orator for their special interest projects, such as their attempts at recreating the [[Elven Legion|Elven]] art of [[astral divination]] throughout the [[Renascence period]].

## Stewards of the state religion

Dealing with the darkness – literal, emotional, and metaphysical – of the [[Red Death period]], humanity within [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] were well-primed to return to their worship of [[Ylem]] rather than simply worshipping their various [[Pact magics|patron]] [[Aspect|Aspects]]. The [[Elven Signaltower]] became a powerful symbol and the House of the Sun who tended to it became as leaders of worship.

The [[#Daywatch]] who during the [[Long Daylight]] had cultivated the closest relationship to the [[nyxfire motes]] of any of the races of the [[Orior]] since the [[Sun Elves]] themselves – and who had even been blessed with visions in their [[nyxfire]] flames – played an especially important role in facilitating practices of worship. Though separate from the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]], they collaborated closely with the many [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] and even the City's [[cults]] to ensure that both means of worship saw support in Court and from the populace.
