The Canon of Heterodoxies is a powerful theocratic [[Union]] of [[House|Houses]] that holds [[Court]] majority in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. The Heterodoxies themselves form the backbone of the City of Gardens, both creating a syncretic culture of [[Henotheist|henotheistic]] worship and inextricably tying together the [[Social Spheres Theory|Spheres]] of [[Social Spheres Theory#Sphere of Worship|Worship]] and [[Social Spheres Theory#Sphere of Industry|Industry]]. Followers of [[Iconic House|heterodoxic]] belief systems do not denounce other [[Ylem]] in favor of their preferred [[Aspect]], but rather specialize their worship according to familial and cultural customs that tend to yield preferable [[Iconic pacts|iconic]] boons.

## Role of the Canon in matters of the Court

Just barely holding onto a [[Court]] majority, the Canon of Heterodoxies holds significant influence as a [[Union]] of [[House|Houses]] but suffers from frequent infighting as the agendas of individual Houses conflict. While the [[House of the Sun]]'s state religion is generally accepted, individual [[Iconic House|heterodoxies]] tend to bicker about the relative influence of their [[iconic pacts|patron]] [[Aspect|Aspects]] and even serve as tools for these [[Ylem]] to increase their own standing.

The Canon stands to ensure that matters of the Court do not impose on the wishes nor agendas of various Aspects or impede the upholding of iconic pacts with them. The vast and growing number of Ylem with influence in the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]] make the entry of these specifics into the [[Hall of Precedent]] difficult and maintenance impossible. Instead, the Canon serves as the voice of their patrons in Court. While certain [[Houses of Industry]] may not need to be present for every Court matter, it is imperative that the heterodoxies work to preserve their pacts.

## Entering the Canon

[[Iconic House|Heterodoxies]] that are not influential enough to receive [[House|Houseship]] are called "[[cults]]". Both major and minor cults exist throughout [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], with varying levels of prominence and favor with with the canonized heterodoxies of the [[Court]].

For a cult, entering the religious canon means gaining both Houseship and a modicum of power in Court. Canonization represents significant economic and social opportunity for its members and greater influence in the [[Known World]] for its [[iconic pacts|patron]] [[Aspect]]. The backing of the Canon and their slight Court majority is imperative for any cult looking to gain this prestige. Their support is dependent on a number of criteria that will be verified by a specially-appointed commission acting in a joint investigation by members of both the heterodoxies and [[House of the Sun]] scholars:

- **Sponsorship.** The backing of another, already canonized Aspect is typically the first step in seeking canonization, but is not a strict requirement. Generally, sponsorship leads to a greater focus on confirming separation, but otherwise can streamline confirmation of the other criteria.

- **Separation.** Describes a uniqueness of the Aspect's domain, indicating sufficient separateness from the other canonized Aspects. Due to the phenomena of [[formitation]], [[Ylem]] have multiple forms across geographical, cultural, and religious borders, so the Canon of Heterodoxies are careful to confirm separation and prevent any of their neighbors from stealing additional Court power for themselves.

- **Influence.** Describes the number and dedication of one's worshipers. Practices of worship vary greatly from Aspect to Aspect – informed by the needs and wants of the Ylem itself – and can range from the burning of a single [[sol]] of food to the harvesting of crops to human sacrifice. This is fairly easily confirmed by a review of the cult's own records, including receipts of worship called [[libelli]] (singular "libellus"), and an observation of these rituals in practice.

- **Inspiration.** What has worship of this Aspect wrought? How have its worshippers, those who have entered into iconic pacts with it, and the wider population of the City benefitted? A common tactic to ensure that this criterium is met is the funding and production of a [[Great Works|Great Work]] to adorn one of the many walls or gardens of Omphalos, the City of Gardens. Another is to seek a [[Questing Charter]] in honor of this patron.
