## Cosmic indifferentism

Cosmic indifferentism, of which a number of less mainstream means of faith including deist faith would subscribe to, on its face seems like a perfect fit for the setting of Heavens Above; Gardens Below (HAGB). This project has focused and will primarily focus so specifically on a specific [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|city]] on a specific [[Known World|world]] within a [[Nyx|wider cosmos]] that is itself sentient and has its own agenda. When speaking on this scale and about extradimensional entities like [[Ylem]] or the [[Dragon]] who are very likely entirely removed from mortal experience, I instinctively lean towards the assumption that human experience and suffering is of little consequence.

To a higher-dimensional being, human history *should* be less consequential than ants are to us. In this case, perhaps a better analogy would be the gap in signficance between a human being and the microscopic organisms that populate the ecosystem of their body. There is a scale above what we can possibly understand with our limited dimensionality and the perspectives we are able to assume based on our own experiences.

In this case, it is a war for all of reality, undertaken by reality itself and in which we would all be a part of simply by existing. We *are* a part of it, with every step and action we take and by just participating in our relatively less-than-microscopic lives. In truth, there is little point to the cosmos caring about any single people or world or even galaxy. And perhaps even less point to us as its inhabitants caring too deeply about the above-macroscopic movements of the universe as a whole.

These are deep ideas and themes, and to me they are not only intrinsically engaging but natural and intuitive logical leaps when talking about something as large-scale as our own universe let alone one that exists in a fantasy setting.

## Cosmic malignity

But cosmic indifferentism isn't exactly the best fit for this setting either. Yes reality of the [[Nyx]] itself might reasonably be indifferent towards the actions and plight of humanity within the [[Known World]], but there's another relevant party in this great [[roiling of the Nyx]] that the events described here are all a part of.

The [[Dragon]], unreality itself, is quite necessarily not a part of reality. It is beyond macroscopic in scale just as much as [[Ylem]] is. But it is also the space between matter, the gaps between numbers, language, and ideas. Everything that is a part of reality is a piece of unreality that has been aggressively, violently ripped out of the whole, and the Dragon is not happy about it.

Unreality cannot be anything less than malicious towards humanity and anything else that is a part of the system that is systematically dismantling it. It is a malignant cancer on reality that is actively working to compress it, applying pressure from both within and without.

It is also not mindless. It has an agenda, weapons with which to seek victory, and soldiers who have allied themselves with it. What it is not is a living thing. It cannot be killed or dissuaded or stopped indefinitely. Based on all that we know of our own universe, it very likely *will* win eventually.

## The human perspective

The perspective of the cosmos is one thing, but what about that of humanity in the [[Known World]]. The indifference of the cosmos towards humanity can reasonably be met with indifference in kind. But what must the malignity of an aggressive and antagonistic cosmos be met with? How can it elicit anything less than fear and existential dread and the compulsion to fight back if given the chance?

Human history as I've planned it thus far is divided into two periods split by a single event. For all of the [[Heliotropic Age]], the [[Crisis of Hubris]], and the [[Renascence]], humanity is ignorant of the true nature of the [[Nyx]] and in their ignorance adopts the nobility of the [[Sun Elves]]. After the [[Enlightenment of the Orator]] via the Elven art of [[astral divination]] , they no longer have that ignorance to hide behind. In this new [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], how are they to respond to these secret truths and what role will they forge for themselves in this conflict?

### Ignorance and nobility

The mentorship of the [[Sun Elves]] – who may or may not hold an understanding of the true nature of the [[Nyx]] themselves – leaves humanity of the [[Known World]] with a noble outlook on a grim reality. They are, after all, the chosen inheritors of a [[fallen world]], quite literally operating outside of the divine blueprint of the [[Angels]] yet still they are trying to be what they've been told they were meant to be.

I do absolutely want to play around with this noble dark tone, which I find incredibly engaging. It's part trying to be something they simply aren't, trying to see a nobility that just doesn't exist in a world that continued to beat down on them. The entirety of the [[Crisis of Hubris]] is an extended cautionary tale, almost like I as the author am trying to grab hold of their shoulders and shake some sense into them. But they won't take to it.

And what does an ignorant nobility develop into throughout and after something like that? I don't want to push my ethics and morality onto those who live in this setting, I think that's an incredibly boring way to explore these themes. I think the meat of this exploration should instead be the reactionary perspectives that naturally arise from the hard times. Instead, I've filled the history of the Known World and [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] with cautionary tales with morals that have been misread and misunderstood and mundane events that have been twisted into cautionary tales that never should have been. Sometimes, this happens in real life. Sometimes, we look back on particularly bad times with a fondness that can only come from shared trauma.

One example I come back to is the tendency to remember a sense of comradery in the wake of the September 11 attacks in New York City. In reality it was the white in-group that was afforded such reassurance while the peoples of many other backgrounds and cultures instead faced aggression and violence from their neighbors. In a way, the concept of nobility in a world of grays is just the same: a sometimes willful misunderstanding of our reality and our actual or potential roles within it.

### Apatheism and misotheism

In the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], however, how are they to maintain this façade? They know – or at least an in-group knows – that they don't live in a world where true nobility is possible, or at least where nobility has any real place or impact on the events to come.

I may be a pessimist, but I feel I can intuit the reactionary response to this information. Feigned nobility turns to bitterness and a sense of betrayal. Pantheism and henotheism turn to apatheism and eventually misotheism: apathy towards and then hatred of the gods themselves.
