The [[Elven March]] along the [[Gold Coast]], west of the [[Valley of Ruins]] and south of the [[Deep Deserts]], lasted centuries if not a millennium. Untold generations of humans, shepherded by five generations of [[Sun Elves]] across the perilous landscapes of the [[Known World]]. Protectors against the [[Wild Magics]] and their [[nyxfire]] storms and the ruthless hordes they begot.

Though a noble undertaking to be sure, the [[Elven Legion|Legion]] was slowed down almost to a crawl by their slower, weaker wards, threatening the success of the divine quest handed down to them from the [[Angels]] themselves. And thinking of the betterment of humanity itself, how could this people continue their evolution this way, shielded from the light of [[Ylem]] in the shadow of their mentors?

Questioning, for perhaps the first time, the path forward, the conversation spread through the Legion's camps each night like wildfire as their [[Griot|Griots]] consulted Ylem with their [[astral divination]]. [[Human clans#Clan Lightbringer|Clan Lightbringer]], the closest of the [[human clans]] to their camps at the front of the March, were the first to know of the coming change. Knowing its significance, they kept it from their brethren save the greatest among them: [[Clan Wolfstepper]] and the [[Rookish clans]].

These great clans, in many ways protectors of humanity just as much as the Sun Elves were, stood before the Legion and spoke for their brethren even without their knowledge. And over the last years of the March, this conversation produced a single idea: a great human civilization founded at the center of the Known World, the great City of Gardens that would come to be known as [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|Omphalos]].

When the Legion came across the lands that would become the City, they saw the gardens there and felt the pull of the [[polar onyx deposit]] and knew that this was the center of the Known World. Their people having undergone this process in their native world and in every world visited since, construction of the Elven Signaltower began almost immediately.

The [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] offered up the white [[wol stone]] from the heart of the land itself, the [[Mundial Aspects#water motes|water motes]] cut the raw material into huge stone blocks, and the [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind motes]] helped the Sun Elves to carry and raise it on high. When the stone blocks stood 150 strides tall and towered over the gardens, they once again called on the earth motes to bring forth a gargantuan core of solid [[Docetic materials#onyx|onyx]].

Typically too volatile to touch as the deposits that lock the Known World itself in its place in the greater Nyx, this core had been prepared millennia ago for the Legion that should have inherited this world. It been kept safe throughout the [[fallen world|fall]] of the [[Old World]] and the [[roiling of the elements]] that came after for this very purpose. Once carefully raised into place, the Sun Elves used their [[Organic magics of the Elven Legion|organic magics]] to light the core into a blinding and eternal flame of pure nyxfire.

And in doing so, they cast the light of Ylem and the order of the Angels across the Known World and tamed a great many of the Wild Magics that had besieged it since the fall. The peoples of this world, the races of the [[Orior]] and of the [[Noble beasts]], are said to have seen this light and – freed of the chaos of the nyxfire storms – and began their journey of standing up to the light of Ylem.

Thrust into the [[Later Heliotropic Age]] by the end of the March, the human clans sought to adjust to sedentary life in the months it took to complete construction on the Signaltower. They settled the gardens around its base, a chaotic sea of colorful tents with pathways winding between them.

This early settlement was lawless. Hundreds of disparate clans now forced to live side by side instead of one behind the other and each with their own laws and customs. The great clans attempted to keep the peace, but in most cases [[Law and justice in the City#cland justice|cland justice]] prevailed. This time of unrest saw the fracturing of the Rookish clans, and necessitated the founding of the [[Court]].

The [[Oremongers Guild]], born of the clans closest to the elemental earth motes brought a kind of end to this period with the forming of their [[Iconic pact of the Oremongers Guild|iconic pact]]. Channeling perhaps the greatest magics humanity has ever wielded, their [[Oremongers Guild#earth shapers|earth shapers]] commanded roads, structures, and the City walls themselves to rise up out of the earth. The urban sprawl that would come to be known as the [[Old City]] of Omphalos, City of Gardens was the greatest wonder built by mortals since the fall of the Old World.

A City all their own and under the protection of their own, no longer relying on the Sun Elves of the Legion, such was the precipice of the [[Later Heliotropic Age|First Golden Age]] of humanity. With the Signaltower completed and their wards having found their place in the world, the Legion was free to continue the March and their divine quest through the [[Lands to the south]].
