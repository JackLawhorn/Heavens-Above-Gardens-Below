The Valley of Ruins comprises much of the [[Old World continent]], stretching from the [[Sun Coast]] and [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] to the south to the outskirts of the [[Deep Deserts]] to the north.

Home to [[prehistory|prehistoric]] humanity alone and no other races of the [[Orior]] until the rise of the [[Procyon gaze]] in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], the Valley of Ruins has stood largely uninhabited for all of recorded history. The many [[goblins|goblin clans]] born out of the [[nyxfire]] storms of the [[Wild Magics]] are one prominent exception.

## Remnants of the Old World

Its [[nyxfire]] storms cleared first by the [[Sun Elves]], the Valley of Ruins holds what are assumed to be the last remaining remnants of the [[Old World]]. Though long weathered – and in many cases partially buried by the [[Roiling of the elements|roiling]] of the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] – these lands are dotted with the ruins of impossibly large statues and megastructures.

Easily seen from a distance and the only evidence of cultures in the region, these serve as the primary landmarks for the [[Wayfarers Guild]] and other explorers. These were assumed by the Legion to be left by the last great civilization before the [[fallen world|fall]] or to be artifacts of the [[Giants]] fallen down from their [[Giants#Empire of Dyēus|Empire of Dyēus]]. There exists a clear technological and aesthetic difference between artifacts from these respective sources.

### Landmarks

The [[Heads of the Old Ones]], giant statues presumed to depict the people of the last great civilization of the Old World. All at least partially buried, it is unknown if these artifacts are limited to just the visible heads or if they extend far underground to depict the whole of these figures. The Heads lay at what are assumed to have been natural intersections in the landscape, serving as directional headings.

The great size of the Heads was at first assumed to imply that this people were as large as the [[Giants]] themselves, but other ruins suggest they were more similar in size to the humans and Elves. One such ruin is the [[City in the Mount]], a sprawling, fossilized urban metropolis entirely encased within a single mountain in the Valley.

In contrast, the artifacts of the Giants, the first children of the [[Mundial Aspects#elemental motes|elemental motes]] and the greatest of the [[Minor Aspects]], are distinct as they have fallen from the [[Giants#Empire of Dyēus|Empire of Dyēus]] above. By all accounts a warlike people, many of these have a connection to tools of war. The [[Forest of Blades]] holds Giant swords and spears without number, cast down onto the surface of the [[Known World]] in some unknown barrage of ages past. Similarly, the [[Axestrike Channel]] is an ancient canal spanning almost the length of the valley itself, and created by the strike of a single Giant axe head.

## The skylands above

One unique geographical feature of the Valley of Ruins is the [[skylands]] which sit above the surface. They are locked in place, unaffected by either gravity or the whims of the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind motes]], and so it is assumed that each contains a sizeable deposit of [[Docetic materials#onyx|onyx]].

These skylands vary in size, ranging from a few strides across to the size of an entire mountain. Though no human or Elf has been known to reach them, many can be seen to hold gargantuan artifacts and it is thought that they may have been the first footholds used by the [[Giants]] to reach and found their [[Giants#Empire of Dyēus|Empire of Dyēus]] above.
