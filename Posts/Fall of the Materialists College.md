The [[Materialists College]] was the third of the [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the [[Court]] to [[Fallen Houses|fall]], and the first to fall in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]]. Their first crime was one of intellect. Their second was one so macabre that their legacy is forever tainted both in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and across the [[Known World]].

## Necromancers of the Materialists College

The [[Crisis of Hubris]] served as a powerful reminder of humanity's vulnerability, with the losses of the [[Oremongers Guild]] and [[House Lightbringer]] leaving them not only without some of their greatest leaders but also without their most powerful magics. Throughout the [[Red Death period]], the scholars and leadership of the [[Materialists College]] were largely unable to find solutions to the threats of the [[Red Court]]. Additionally, their biggest contribution to the campaigns in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] against this enemy led to the disastrous [[Long Daylight]] which only worsened the situation.

Some time after this period, experiments began in study of a new subset of [[materialist magics]] which was seen as a potent new source of power that would dramatically shift human history and their place within the [[Known World]]. This new field, which the College anatomists later called [[necromancy]], built on the foundational ideas of materialism but with a focus on accessing the latent [[organic magics]] in the remains of the [[noble beasts]] and other races of the [[Orior]].

In order to acquire the "raw material" needed for these experiments, a number of excursions were undertaken both in secret and officially under the guise of various scholarly endeavors. The first of these excursions yielded only relatively insignificant results, with material taken from unsuspecting victims: noble beasts with minor organic magics of their own. After the first necromantic artifacts were created to empower their scholars, the excursions became more brazen as well as more successful until entire villages of other races of the Orior were slaughtered for their raw material.

Though evidence is scarce – with much documentation burned by the College when the discovery of their crimes seemed imminent – these death squads are thought to have operated for months.

### Killing of the Sobek

The [[organic magics]] of the [[Sobek]] made them a prime target for the [[necromancer demons]] of the [[Materialists College]]. Their research, based on initial scouting missions and the legends passed down since the [[Elven March]], indicated that this race of the [[Orior]] crafted armor from the bones of their ancestors and their fallen to accumulate and pass down a compounding degree of physical strength.

Although their death squads did wipe out a number of the Sobek and retrieve their remains for study and preservation, they found the forces of the riverfolk too great and sustained significant losses themselves. It was ultimately these losses and the testimonies of the surviving victims that uncovered the [[College]]'s crimes.

## Consequences of the fall

News of the [[Triumph of the Sobek|Triumph]] of the [[Sobek]] marching on [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] first came from the [[Messengers Guild]] who, in those days immediately following the end of the [[Red Death period]], had their [[Rookish clans|Rookish]] scouts monitoring the region for potential threats. Their reports were delivered directly to the [[Silver Wolves]], who dispatched a pack of two dozen to meet them. Seeking not to cause undue panic in the vulnerable and still-grieving populace, this information was limited to the Messengers Guild, the Silver Wolves and their [[Orator]], and the Orator of the [[House of the Sun]].

As luck would have it, the Orator of the [[Materialists College]] had been absent for some time and rejected requests to meet with his peers. When the accusations of the Sobek were relayed to the Silver Wolves and to the Rookish scouts, this secret was maintained as to not alarm the College to their suspicions. The Triumph arrived in the City only days later, when the ashen elders of the Sobek made their accusations directly to the Orators, whose judgement followed immediately after.

### Judgement of the Orators

Unlike the falls of the [[Oremongers Guild]] and [[House Lightbringer]] in the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]], the [[Materialists College]]'s own fall left its scholars alive to suffer the consequences. Prepared for the arrival of the [[Triumph of the Sobek|Triumph]] and informed of their accusations against the [[College]], the [[Orator|Orators]] of the other [[Great House|Great Houses]] – at this point only the [[House of the Sun]] and the [[Silver Wolves]] – readied trusted agents of the [[Jurisweard]] who were put in place to swiftly enact justice once the accusations of the [[Sobek]] could be made first-hand.

Within a span of only minutes, their Orator was detained and brought before the others, the laboratories of the [[necromancer demons]] were raided and evidence collected, and dozens of [[Materialist magics|materialist]] scholars were rounded up for later questioning. Their Orator was accused by his peers upon the steps of the [[Court]], before nearly the entire population of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. He was summarily kicked down the steps and killed by the mob.

The trials of the apprehended scholars lasted weeks. Those proven to have taken part in their College's dark experiments were [[#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exiled]] from the City, at least those who weren't executed by the Jurisweard or killed by the populace before their departure. Only a few innocents remain, now [[House|Houseless]].

### Public reception

The [[Fallen Houses|fall]] of the [[Materialists College]] caught humanity in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] – still reeling from the losses of the [[Red Death period]] and of the [[Burning]] – by surprise. At the time, the [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]], the [[Fall of House Lightbringer|fall]] of [[House Lightbringer]], and the Red Death period were of course great losses but it was largely believed that the City's triumph over the forces of the [[Red Court]] had brought the devastation to an end.

The mob insighted upon the steps of the [[Court]] tore the [[College]]'s disgraced [[Orator]] to pieces in their disgust. In the weeks that followed, [[Materialist magics|materialist]] scholars in hiding – even those who had not been under the formal patronage of the College – were killed by their neighbors or turned in to the [[Jurisweard]] to sit trial. Many of those sentenced to [[#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exile]] from the City were similarly killed before their departure.

Today, remnants of this betrayal can still be seen in the City. Prejudice against materialist magics and those who hold materialist trinkets is not uncommon. Later – after the [[necromancer demons]] of the [[Isle of Melos]] were common knowledge – it is common for merchants and [[House|Houses]] of commerce to smell [[Currencies of the City#Gold|gold coins]] before accepting them, testing for [[Currencies of the City#Counterfeit currency|devils gold]].

### Exile and flight of the necromancers

The flight of the [[necromancer demons]] of the [[Materialists College]] happened quickly upon the arrival of the [[Triumph of the Sobek|Triumph]] of the [[Sobek]], and they were right to do so. In the weeks that followed, dozens of [[Materialist magics|materialists]] were captured and many either killed by their neighbors or executed by agents of the [[Jurisweard]]. Both those who fled capture and those who were exiled by the [[Court]] – would go on to found the [[Isle of Melos]] where they continue their dark experiments. This sentence was meant to be death but there, on their [[Isles of the Great Sea|Isle]] upon the [[Great Sea]], they've managed to grow and thrive.
