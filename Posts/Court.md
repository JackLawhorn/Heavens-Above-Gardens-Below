The Court of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] is a parliament following a dikastocractic structure â€“ a form of government in which the power lays with one or more judges. The Court is comprised of the [[House|Houses]] and their [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]], the [[Great House|Great Houses]] and their [[Orator|Orators]], and the [[Hand of the Court]] which is selected to execute and enforce the law.

## Structure of the Court

Within the Court, entities which control industry or otherwise produce goods and services become political entities called [[House|Houses]], led by [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]]. The several hundred Houses each possess equal voting power in matters of the Court, though real power is often exerted through [[Union|Unions]] comprised of several Houses in similar industries or whose interests otherwise align.

From the Houses, a number of [[Great House|Great Houses]] have been selected, which sacrifice their voting power and are instead represented by an [[Orator]]. The Orators preside over matters of the Court, judge to the jury that the Houses represent. As of the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], the [[House of the Sun]] is the last remaining Great House of the Court.

The Orator(s) select a House or other entity to be [[Hand of the Court]] on a case-by-case basis to execute on matters of the Court.
