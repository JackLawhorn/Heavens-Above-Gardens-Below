> This high history is captured in the [[House of the Sun]]'s historical archives, transcribed from oral history during [[Reconstruction]]. Though free to access under [[Public Scholarship]] law, the [[Office of the Orator]] reminds us that the storied [[Fall of the Silver Wolves]] during the [[Crisis of Hubris]] teaches us that one's ambitions of exultation stoke one's appetite for betrayal.

The [[Lunar Aspects|moons]] sat full above the [[Known World]], above the camps that the [[Sun Elves]] and the [[human clans]] had made for themselves. The larger of the two, the [[silver moon]] was as the eye of the [[Nyx]] itself, trained on the world below. It was to be a night of predators, of the hunt.

Hunters from each of the clans, their skills honed by generations of close observation of the Elves, gathered by moonlight before starting the trek east, away from the coastline. As they approached the tree line of one of the [[Valley of Ruins]]' many forests, their chatter went quiet. Their prey should not hear them coming. Worse, something larger and with the taste of flesh might hear them, see them far from the protection of the Elves.

Hours went by blanketed in this silence, but little was caught. A pig. A squirrel. A snake. The forest itself seemed restless, and did not yield enough prey to feed their camps for even one night.

Suddenly, a voice from the [[Nyx]] above.

_"Follow the light, hunters of the night. My children. Predators among your kind. Your mother calls to you."_

The hunters found themselves to be surrounded by wolves – more than any human had ever seen – silently emerging from the silver moonlight itself. Though startled, they kept their quiet. The wolves had been allies to the humans as they were to the Elves, and did not bare their teeth or flash their claws.

_"Come to me and claim your exultation. Claim the night and your place in this world under the [[Nyx]]. Choose my light. Or return to your camps and remain as you are, as your people are."_

Sharing glances of concern, the human hunters found themselves unable to speak. This congregation, this pack of hundreds or even thousands moved as a stream around them, their heads bowed as if in reverence. They moved without a sound, the silence of the night broken only by the chirps and croaks of the beasts of the night. What voice, what magics, were calling to these wolves?

_"Your kind have lived in fear since [[Fallen world|the fall]]. Come to me and fear no more. Come to me and make fear itself your prey."_

Not all the hunters did stay, choosing instead to return to their clans, to their stations. Some back at the camps heard the call themselves and came to answer it. All in all, just under one hundred of humanity's hunters entered that forest, followed those wolves.

Those who followed walked for hours, walked further and further away from their camps on the coast. Passing breaks in the tree line, they found the wolves to be injured and sickly. Many limped, more still appeared to be blind. Passing under breaks in the canopy, they saw that all of them to a one bore scars visible through their matted gray fur.

_"My pack, my children are broken. The ages have been hard on them. These campaigns of your [[Elven Legion]] have been hard on us all."_

The heavenly voice came from all around, reverberating through the shimmering silver moonlight. It was strange, frightening even, but familiar. Warm like the voice of a mother.

As they walked, the hunters put down their weapons, stripped away their garments. What need had the wolves for such things? They themselves would not have need for them again. Through dense foliage, over rivers and stones, they walked. Their feet blistered and bled and still they walked.

Finally, they arrived. The wolves, and the humans who now were as wolves themselves, stopped in a break in the trees. Something giant had formed this clearing, and there was space enough for the thousands in attendance. Now out from under the canopy, the [[silver moon]] hung above their heads, bigger or perhaps closer than it had ever appeared. Beams of moonlight vibrated with power like the chord of an instrument. Some echoed with words spoken by the mysterious voice, other conjured strange and incredible visions.

_"We are broken, but by the light of [[Ylem]] we will be repaired once more."_

Finally, from one such beam emerged one last wolf. Gargantuan in form, it stood several strides taller than the humans. Like the others, she was old and blind and scarred. Her skin was pockmarked with injuries that looked as though they should have killed her. Before her, the grizzled old wolves bowed and the humans who were as wolves followed their lead once more.

And then she spoke, and hers was the voice of the [[silver moon]] above. _"I am the [[Lunar Aspects#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]], daughter of the [[Nyx]]. Mother of all you here tonight and of all the predators of this world. Tonight is a night of death and rebirth. Of a beginning and an end. Of exultation."_

Though her blindness was clear to see, the hunters felt the intensity of her gaze. It came not from the wolf before them but from the eye in the night sky above.

_"Humans,"_ her voice boomed, _"stand now before me."_ And they did.

_"Do you know who I am? Do you know what it is I offer you?"_ Still, they could not speak, but understand they did.

_"I sense the change in you already. You are more my children now than your own kind."_ They felt the change too. The sharpness of their senses, their very nature.

_"You are humans who are as wolves. The next generation of my children and every generation after them will be even greater. Wolves who are as humans. I will be here to watch over you, for my great eye sees all under the night sky. Our lineage will stretch to the end of this world and beyond."_ ^678e0f

For each human, down came a beam of silver moonlight. And from each beam emerged a dagger of pure silver. The [[Lunar Aspects#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]] winced in pain and said, _"This is my body, which I have shed for you. Wield these arms and accept the future I have forged for you."_

Grasping the silver daggers, the hunters felt a surge of power that no human had ever felt. It was at this moment that [[Clan Wolfstepper]] was formed. That they had accepted the [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]] of their patron [[Aspect]] and became the [[Silver Wolves]].

But the Wolf Mother hardly seemed pleased. _"Look around you, my children. Your forebearers have succumbed to their wounds."_ And it was as she said. The wolves were no longer bowed but lay dead before their mother.

The moonlight shimmered once again, and as Wolf Mother faded away with it she said, _"You are my pack now. Come out into the forest, far from your humankind on any moonlit night and I will be there to greet you. For now, return to your camps and tell them of your exultation. You are the first but you will not be the last."_

It was morning when the [[Silver Wolves]] emerged from the forests of the [[Valley of Ruins]] and arrived at their camps.

They did not emerge as they had entered.
