Children of the [[Nyx]] itself, Lunar Aspects are powerful deities in orbit around the [[Known World]]. They are generally more powerful than the [[Mundial Aspects]] – which govern all that lies below the Nyx – but may be similar in strength to the various [[Umbral Aspects]].

## The Wolf Mother

> For more, see [[Wolf Mother]].

The largest of the two moons still in the night sky, the [[Wolf Mother]] is a powerful Lunar Aspect and patron [[Aspect]] to all predators of the land. Her most notable children in the history of humanity within [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] are the [[Silver Wolves]] of [[Clan Wolfstepper]].

## The White Owl

> For more, see [[White Owl]].

The White Owl is the patron [[Aspect]] of all the predators of the sky. Her agents reconnoitering all that happens in the [[Known World]], she has also come to be known as a symbol of truth and secret knowledge. The white moon is the smallest of the three moons, but is thought to be the most powerful known Aspect despite exercising little influence with that power. Flitting about through portals manifested as mirrors, glass, and other reflective surfaces, the owls are said to maintain a massive library of all truths.

## <strike>The Fallen Son</strike>

> For more, see [[Fallen Son]].

The largest of the [[Known World]]'s Lunar Aspects, the [[Fallen Son]] fell from the [[Nyx]] long ago and came crashing into the deepest depths of the [[Sink]]. Before the [[Fallen world|fall]], the blue moon served as [[Aspect]] of the tides. Without his presence in the night sky, the seas are calm above yet restless below.

In this new home – where the sea is as motionless and as inky black as the [[Dragon]] – he lays in a deep slumber, a sleeping god nevertheless worshipped by his children the [[Akụm]]. In this dreaming state, he has instead become an [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]].

## Rituals and natural phenomena

Sitting in the [[Nyx]] itself, far above the surface of the [[Known World]], the lunar forms of these [[Aspect|Aspects]] are visibly affected by the cycles of the [[roiling of the Nyx]]. During and across these cycles, they are under various degrees of [[benighted|benighting]], by which the light of the [[Ylem]] is partially or wholly obscured by the Known World or some other celestial sphere.

### Lunar phases

The degree of visibility of the Lunar Aspects and their [[Albedo]] – categorized into four lunar phases – have significant influence over their influence within the Prime Material Sphere as well as the strength of their [[Iconic pacts]]. Full moons are wholly visible and at the peak of their power and influence. Crescent moons are mostly [[benighted]], while [[hasta moons]] – after which the Elven spearheads are designed and the Old Elven word for spear is named – are only partially benighted.

On [[moonless nights]], the lunar forms are wholly benighted. As they are as the eyes of the Lunar Aspects – through which they keep watch over the [[Known World]] – they are effectively blind. Moonless nights can and have been instigated by the Lunar Aspects themselves, purposefully blinding themselves to the goings on of the Known World.

The lunar phases, subject to the greater [[roiling of the Nyx]] and to the whims of the Lunar Aspects themselves, cannot be consistently, accurately predicted except by the Elven [[Griot|Griots]] and their [[astral divination]].

### Perigeas

> For more, see [[perigeas]].

There exists a natural phenomenon of the [[Nyx]] called [[perigeas]] by which a Lunar Aspect is both full and [[benighted|unbenighted]], and simultaneously at its closest point to the surface of the [[Known World]]. [[Iconic pacts]] with the Lunar Aspects become far more powerful during perigeas, as does the [[Aspect]]'s influence.

Perigeas are infrequent, often occurring only once every age, but often align with divine and prophesized [[Quest|Quests]] for the Aspect's iconic worshippers. Famously, a perigeas was predicted to take place on the moonless night that spelt the fall of [[Clan Wolfstepper]]. Now unable to speak with the [[Wolf Mother]] herself, the abandoned remnants of the fallen Clan now argue that the lack of a true perigeas disproves the [[New Silver Age]]'s claims of divine quest.

### The Moon-Touched

> For more, see [[Moon-Touched]].

As rare as [[perigeas]], the [[Moon-Touched]] are another naturally-occurring phenomenon of the Lunar Aspects and their influence on the [[Known World]]. The Moon-Touched are the children of the Lunar Aspects, born of a race of the [[Orior]] and in possession of powerful [[organic magics]].

The most infamous example of this is the [[Luminary]] – [[Luminary#Prophesy of the Luminary|prophesized]] child of the [[Orator]]'s daughter and her [[Silver Wolves|Silver Wolf]] lover, kidnapped by the [[New Silver Age]].
