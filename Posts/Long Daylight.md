After proving that the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] could swiftly be vanquished by exposure to the light of [[Ylem]], the scholars of the [[Materialists College]] would propose an unprecedented alteration to the [[Elven Signaltower]] before the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]]. Rather than alternating between day and night as designed by the [[Sun Elves]], they would usher in a period of sustained daylight in order to limit the movements of the enemy in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

As the [[Red Death period]] went on and the threats to the populace of the City increased, the Court would ultimately approve the motion, ushering in a phenomena now known as the Long Daylight. This was highly effective in creating [[Red Death period City of Gardens#Bastions from the Red Court|bastions]] from the soldiers of the Red Court, namely around the Signaltower and in the [[Duchy of Stilts]].

## The Daywatch

[[House of the Sun]] signal keepers who tended to the [[Elven Signaltower]] throughout the Long Daylight came to be called the [[House of the Sun#Daywatch|Daywatch]]. Faced with constant exposure to the divinity of its [[nyxfire]] flame, the Daywatch were subject significant physical, psychological, and spiritual side-effects. Ultimately, it was these signal keepers who unleashed the great and devastating [[Burning]] which brough the [[Red Death period]] to its end.

## Consequences of the Long Daylight

The [[Elven Signaltower]] is the sun of the [[Known World]], and so the consequences of altering its design and function were felt far and wide. The natural rhythms of day and night created by the Signaltower's mechanisms expose the population of this world to the divine light of [[Ylem]] throughout the day and to the wider [[Nyx]] at night. Those rhythms interrupted, one suffers a number of psychological and physiological side effects, including drowsiness or sleeplessness, depression, anxiety, irritability, and even a compromised immune system.

### Effects on the City of Gardens

Beyond effects on the population, the environment around the [[Elven Signaltower]] and especially the urban environment of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] suffered a number of consequences of the harsh and constant light cast by its [[nyxfire]] flame. The shadows cast were impossibly black, thick and substantial. Here, the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] were able to thrive and multiply far from the divine light of Ylem. These areas, concentrated around the outskirts of the City were significantly more dangerous for the [[Apotropaics]] whose patrols entered into [[Red Death period City of Gardens#Enemy territory|enemy territory]] to evacuate survivors and scout out the enemy.

This plus the exposure of the [[Burning]] would have side effects for years after the end of the [[Red Death period]], creating the [[extramundane]] biome known as the [[Shades]].

### Effects across the Known World

Of course, the Long Daylight was experienced all throughout the [[Known World]] except in the [[Great Dark Cold]] far to the south. The other races of the [[Orior]] – risen up by the [[Sun Elves]] and their divine influence – had heard from these mentors that the sun to the north was the center of their world and its connection to the wider [[Nyx]], and this phenomena was thought to be a sign from the [[Ylem]] themselves. In the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and in throughout [[Renascence period]], a great many of these peoples would launch [[Pilgrims of the Orior|pilgrimages]] to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] inspired by this sign.
