Materialist magics are born of lingering traces of other categories of magic, most commonly [[organic magics]] still present in the organic matter of the remains of those who possess them. The scholars of the [[Materialists College]] identified a process by which the flow of one's [[Albedo]] through the [[Albedo#aura|aura]] alters this matter, physically etching magics into the flesh and bones and blood itself.

Materialist magics generally reflect the organic magics that produced them, albeit significantly less potent. It's common to see the materialist mages of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] equipped with cloaks, rings, and any number of other trinkets that offer particularly practical [[extramundane]] properties.

## Materialist artifacts

Dead plant matter has been found to make for particularly powerful materialist artifacts as these peoples feed directly on the light of [[Ylem]] and hold powerful organic magics of their own. Nearly every materialist mage carries a staff, scepter, or shield of wood petrified by the [[nyxfire]] storms of the [[Wild Magics]].

Feathers, hides, and scales taken from the remains of [[Noble beasts]] are common artifacts studied and worn by materialist mages, though their magics can be limited. More internal components of such remains, such as bone and blood and organs generally contain more potent [[extramundane]] properties. The pursuit of these artifacts led to the dark and terrible [[necromancy]] of the [[Materialists College]] and its [[Necromancer demons|demons]].
