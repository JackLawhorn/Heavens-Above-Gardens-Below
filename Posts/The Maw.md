The Maw exists as a scar upon the [[Known World]] and the [[New City]] district, a reminder of the [[Oremongers Guild]] and their [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]]. Enveloped by verdancy in the centuries since, it is a peculiar and striking landmark that elicits awe of the power of nature and its [[Mundial Aspects]]. Quiet and serene, you would be forgiven for forgetting that it is also the largest mass grave in all of the Known World: the final resting place of hundreds of Guild mages swallowed up by the earth.

## Undergardeners

The Maw, now a park populated by gardens encouraging thoughtful reflection and reverence, is considered a historical site as well as a holy site by many. So as not to become overgrown, it is tended to just as any of the other [[Gardens of the City|gardens]] throughout [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

Soon after its creation at the hands of the [[Mundial Aspects|elemental motes]] at the [[fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]], humanity became embroiled in the fight against the [[Red Court]] and their [[Red Plague|plague]] and the site was largely left to be enveloped by verdancy. Even later – during [[Reconstruction]] – the Maw was very much still seen with superstition as the site of such a catastrophic disaster and responsibility ultimately fell to an unlikely party.

The Undergardeners who tend to the Maw are almost entirely comprised of the surviving members of the Oremongers Guild and their descendants. Themselves scarred and their bloodlines forever marked as [[Warlock|warlocks]] who broke their [[Pact magics|pact]] with the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]], this service is their penance. An important and respected charge, this work has helped them to avoid the public scrutiny faced by several of the other [[Fallen Houses]].
