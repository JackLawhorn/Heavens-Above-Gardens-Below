The Maw exists as a scar upon the [[Known World]] and the [[New City]] district, a reminder of the [[Oremongers Guild]] and their [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]]. Enveloped by verdancy in the centuries since, it is a peculiar and striking landmark that elicits awe of the power of nature and its [[Mundial Aspects]]. Quiet and serene, you would be forgiven for forgetting that it is also the largest mass grave in all of the Known World: the final resting place of hundreds of Guild mages swallowed up by the earth.

The Undergardeners who tend to the Maw are almost entirely comprised of the surviving members of the [[Oremongers Guild]] and their descendants. Themselves scarred and their bloodlines forever marked as [[Warlock|warlocks]] who broke their [[Pact magics|pact]] with the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]], this service is their penance. An important and respected charge, this work has helped them to avoid the public scrutiny faced by several of the other [[Fallen Houses]].
