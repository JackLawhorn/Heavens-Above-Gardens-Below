## Religion versus worship

Religion and faith can't be the right words in a setting like this can they? In my own personal journey of understanding religion, I wouldn't ascribe those words to what I'm trying to portray here. In a world where divine entities walk among and convene with humans, faith is unnecessary. And in a universe where the over-god is reality itself and its counterpart is simply unreality, I'm not sure faith is very meaningful either.

[[Ylem]] and its [[Aspect|Aspects]] in the [[Known World]] and across the wider [[Nyx]] are simply another mechanic of humanity's reality. They are observable, interactable, and inextricably tied to ideas and domains that exist in our own world. While one's relationship with these entities might resemble that of an inferior to a superior, this patronage affords concrete and even practically necessary boons.

## Forms of worship

So what real-world aspects of religion and worship would make the most sense in such a world? To me, henotheism and syncretism seem like obvious choices. There's a practicality to readily adopting new deities and worshipping them for the benefits they can grant within their individual domains. But what forms might that worship take? How would the history and cultural influences of humanity in the [[Known World]] affect their idea of worship? How would the reality of [[Ylem]] and the [[roiling of the Nyx]] impact things? What can we imagine that might be thematically consistent?

Given the warlike nature of the [[Sun Elves]], I think it's realistic to assume that war and combat, and even sport and other forms of contest would be valid forms of worship. The Elves themselves are a reflection of the [[Angels]] in their eternal, cosmic conflict, and even the [[Aspect|Aspects]] in the Known World which deviate from their divine order are rebellion incarnate.

That's not to say that more standard forms of worship such as commune and ritual, sacrifice of food and other goods, and even art wouldn't be prominent. The [[Great Works]] that adorn [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], and the City's own nature as a Great Work in its own right, is really interesting to me and so I've leaned into that a bit.

## Worship as a symbiotic relationship

But what is the point of worship? We have a sense of the benefit to the humans: the [[Pact magics|patron]] [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]] are powerful deities with domains all their own and the ability to bestow boons within those domains. But why should those boons be granted?

I feel like in some pantheistic religions the given reason is pride and greed and sins of us humans ourselves projected onto divinity. That doesn't feel great to me though. I don't want the Aspects to feel like people, even if they are characters in their own right. I want them to feel different and other to all living things, I want them to exude arcane wisdom if not outright enlightenment. They have a divine purpose, a part in the [[roiling of the Nyx]] for each of them.

This may be leaning into the mechanics of divinity a little too far for this particular theme, but I have always loved settings where all real-world mythologies are presented as true and warring or even overlapping. Even when not explicitly stated this is a more solipsistic approach, where the gods themselves can be boiled down to the concept of tulpas or thoughtforms. In this sort of a system, divinity is almost a two-way relationship, a symbiotic relationship. Yes, the gods have power beyond anything the mortals could even understand but they themselves only exist because belief in them exists. This is a really interesting idea and ties into some themes I'm planning to explore in the final chapters, the last ages of this setting.

So yes, the point of worship is that both parties benefit. This makes sense as a flow of [[albedo]] between the two within the [[Astral Sphere]]. And during and throughout this flow, benefits are bestowed on both, either great or small.
