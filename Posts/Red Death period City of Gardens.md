## Bastions from the Red Court

With the survivors of the [[Red Death period]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] evacuated behind the [[Red Death period City of Gardens#The warding line|warding line]], the populace aggregated in two locations which offered ready access to the [[Soldiers of the Red Court#Vulnerabilities|vulnerabilities]] of the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]]: around the base of the [[Elven Signaltower]] and in the recently founded [[Barony of Stilts]].

### The Elven Signaltower

> For more, see [[Elven Signaltower]].

Protected by the divine light of [[Ylem]] cast by its [[nyxfire]] flame, the [[Elven Signaltower]] served as the base of operations for those engaged in the [[Campaigns against the Red Court|campaigns]] against the [[Red Court]]. This area also afforded easy access to the rooftops of the City – safer than the streets below cast in the shadow of the surrounding buildings – and to the river [[Torrente]] which played a major part in the campaigns. This area, including the [[Court]] became the primary base of operations populated mostly by the leadership and those who served on the [[#the frontlines|frontlines]].

Leadership fell primarily to the three remaining [[Great House|Great Houses]]: the scholars of the [[Materialists College]], the [[Silver Wolves]] of [[Clan Wolfstepper]], and the [[House of the Sun]]. Operating out of the halls of the Court they struggled to maintain power in the chaos of the times and amidst significant losses to their ranks. Under their leadership were the [[Apotropaics]] who fought on the [[Red Death period City of Gardens#The frontlines|frontlines]], the [[House of the Sun#The Daywatch|Daywatch]] which tended to the Signaltower and its flame, the [[Fisher Barons]] who led the civilians evacuated in the [[Barony of Stilts]], and the [[Shipwrights Guild]] whose engineers built and maintained defensive measures like the [[Red Death period City of Gardens#The warding line|warding line]].

### The Barony of Stilts

> For more, see [[Barony of Stilts]].

The wider populace of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] – fearing the possibility that the [[Elven Signaltower]] would fail and the horrors beyond the [[Red Death period City of Gardens#The warding line|warding line]] would spill over the barricades – retreated further from [[Red Death period City of Gardens#Enemy territory|enemy territory]] to the newly founded [[Barony of Stilts]]. Built on sturdy wooden pilings above the waves of the [[Sink]], this [[City districts|district]] was safe from the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] who could be [[Soldiers of the Red Court#Vulnerabilities|warded off]] by running water.

With hundreds of thousands of new tenants arriving in an unexpected exodus, the [[Red Death period]] saw the origins of the densely populated area known as the [[Barony of Stilts#Shoals|Shoals]]. Built vertically both above and below the boardwalks of the Stilts, it is the most densely populated area in the City and has since been known as a particularly low-class neighborhood where criminals and gangs run rampant. Most infamous were the [[Apotropaics#Berserkers of the Red Moon|Berserkers]] of the [[Red Moon]], [[Apotropaics]] of [[Clan Wolfstepper]] who acted as an organized criminal organization when not on the [[Red Death period City of Gardens#The frontlines|frontlines]].

## The frontlines

Taking advantage of the [[Soldiers of the Red Court#Vulnerabilities|vulnerabilities]] of the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]], the [[Apotropaics]] managed to pen their accursed enemies into what is now the [[Red Quarter]].

### The warding line

The "warding line" was a massive border standing between what are now the [[White Quarter]] and the [[Red Quarter]]. Built by the [[Apotropaics]] and the engineers of the [[Shipwrights Guild]], the heavily fortified barricades stood taller than the surrounding rooftops while also allowing travel over the river [[Torrente]] which the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] could not cross. Although made hastily of wood, it was protected by a lining of silver and the ever-burning warding pyres of the [[House of the Sun]].

### Enemy territory

The enemy territory beyond the [[#the warding line|warding line]] was so saturated in darkness – the [[extramundane]] [[Shades]] only cast by the harsh light of the divine [[nyxfire]] – in which the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] thrived and multiplied and hummed audibly like a swarm of insects. Only the rooftops, which were exposed to the light of [[Ylem]] cast by the [[Elven Signaltower]] were safe to traverse.

### River Torrente

> For more, see [[Torrente]].

The [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] avoided and were [[Soldiers of the Red Court#Vulnerabilities|unable to cross]] running water, and so the river [[Torrente]] was one of the only viable means of ingress and egress across the [[#The warding line|warding line]] and into [[#enemy territory]]. The engineers of the [[Shipwrights Guild]] equipped the [[Apotropaics]] with small shallops so that they might cross through the arches below the barricades.
