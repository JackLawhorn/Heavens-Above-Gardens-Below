# The Roiling of the elements

Spurred on by the [[nyxfire]] storms of the unbound [[Wild Magics]], the [[Mundial Aspects]] of the [[Known World]] were thrust into disarray. Across untold millennia, the conflict known as the roiling of the elements was waged not just between the elements but between the many factions that exist within each of the races of [[Mundial Aspects#elemental motes|elemental motes]].

This roiling warped the landscapes of the Known World, forever altering both its surface and the skies above.

## Birth of the Minor Aspects

Out of the [[Mundial Aspects#elemental motes|elemental motes]] were born the [[Mundial Aspects#motes of the landscapes|motes of the landscapes]], a divine blueprint followed by world after world. Had this world not [[fallen world|fallen]], these motes of the landscapes would have given way to a small number of [[Minor Aspects]] to govern natural phenomena and guide the development of the world's [[Elven Legion]].

The fall of the [[Old World]] and the roiling of the elements that followed produced a great many more Minor Aspects than any world was meant to accommodate. In the new world, the [[Known World]] of humanity, these entities are so plentiful as to be a common site both within and outside of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]. Their agents amongst humanity, the [[iconic pacts|iconic]] paladins of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]], number in the thousands.

The greatest of the Minor Aspects – the [[Giants]] – are also part of the divine blueprint of the worlds, serving as wardens of the domains of surface and sky. A combination of the [[Wild Magics]] and the roiling of the elements led to the further proliferation of this peoples, leading to their own proliferation and eventually to the founding of the [[Giants#Empire of Dyēus|Empire of Dyēus]] by Aker, Aspect of the Horizon.

## Fall of the Fallen Son

In the course of the roiling of the elements, the [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]] now known as the [[Lunar Aspects#<strike>The Fallen Son</strike>|Fallen Son]] came crashing down into the very waters that were his domain to govern. Those few old enough to remember this disaster – the [[Nyxfire motes]] and the [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar]] and [[Mundial Aspects]] – refuse to speak of his fall, but some details have been uncovered.

As the stories go, the Fallen Son was transfixed by the raging [[nyxfire]] below, in which he saw visions of a great future and the freedom that could be found there. He saw untold thousands of civilizations rise and fall, peoples who stood up to the light of [[Ylem]] without conforming to the divine designs of the [[Angels]]. But in his station above the [[Known World]], such freedom – such heretical rebellion – seemed beyond his reach. And so he began his rebellion, insignificant enough with the chaos enrapturing the world, with the exultation of his own peoples: the predators of the [[Sink]]. From their numbers rose what we now know as the [[Akụm]], a race of [[Orior]] relatively safe from the nyxfire storms ravaging the surface.

But this interference was worse than heretical, it was [[paradoxy]] against the Angels and the station they had set for him and for the two other Lunar Aspects. Seeing this, the [[Giants#Foundational Giant myth|foundational Giants]] themselves struck at his lunar form with their great blades of stone, sending him crashing down into the Sink and creating opportunity for Aker, Aspect of the Horizon to wrest control of the sky from them. Now, the Fallen Son lays at the bottom of the Sink, a Lunar Aspect turned [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] and dark patron of his progeny the Akụm.

## Extramundane environments

### The Astral Wilds

> For more, see [[Astral Wilds]].

The miscegenation of the [[Mundial Aspects#motes of the landscapes|motes of the landscapes]] and the [[Nyxfire motes]] riled up by the [[Wild Magics]] during this period led to an [[extramundane]] biome known as the [[Astral Wilds]]. These Wilds blanket the east and it is said that the magics, though tamed, are so concentrated there that they continue to warp the [[Laws of Power]] as the [[nyxfire]] storms of the [[fallen world|fall]] had.

The landscapes of the Wilds are unnatural in the extreme, and its flora and fauna are irrevocably warped by untold millennia of evolution run rampant. The many races of the Wilds possess powerful organic magics, and many take drastically different forms from those outside the Wilds. Most prominent are the floral races of [[Orior]], including their [[Verdant Knights]]. They are also home to an uncommonly high frequency of [[Discoveries in the Known World|noble beasts]].

### The Shades

> For more, see [[Shades]].

The [[Shades]] are biomes cast in the stark shadow of [[nyxfire]] and its divine light. This magical phenomenon is most often caused by proximity to large burns of pure nyxfire, and the peoples of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] had to take great care to prevent creating a Shade as consequence for the great [[Burning]] that ended the [[Red Death period]]. Shades most often manifest in forests, swamps, and caves.

So devoid are the Shades of magical energy that even most [[Ylem]] fear to tread there. Among its peoples are instead some of the more alien races of the [[Orior]], those whose nature it is to remain in the dark rather than basking in the divine light of Ylem. They are most infamous for their native Ylem – [[Umbral Aspects]] known as the [[Shade motes]] – which are the stark shadows of these lands given life of their own.
