A *psion* is a practitioner of the field of [[psionics]], and includes both [[Mystic psionics]] and the [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist scholars]] of the [[Psionics College]]. The term may be used to refer to anyone awakened to their [[psionics|psionic influence]], but is more commonly in reference to a practitioner of one of the prominent [[#psionic factions]].

## Psionic factions

Now, in the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]] the vast majority of the [[Psionics|psionic]] population in the [[Known World]] is thought to be human, though the population size of the wandering [[Muqallid mimics]] is unknown. The growth of the [[#Gljiva, the Conquering Fungus]] – which covers a massive portion of the Known World – identifies as a single psion but otherwise would far outnumber the human psion population.

### Disciples of the Pretender

> For more, see [[Disciples of the Pretender]].

The [[Pretender]] and their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] were the first of the human psions, practicing a form of [[psionics]] called [[Mystic psionics]]. The mystics viewed this new field and the seemingly [[extramundane]] powers it afforded them through the same lens that humanity viewed the [[Magics in the Known World|magics]] of the [[Known World]]. Under their stewardship, [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] blossomed with miracles and entered into the [[Psionic Age]].

Their false messiah, [[Mystic psionics#dwaalstepper|dwaalsteppers]], and [[Mystic psionics#Psiknight|Psiknights]] resembled more a [[cults|cult]] or [[Iconic House|heterodoxy]] than the [[Scholars of the City#objectivists|objectivist science]] that it is now understood as, and certainly it grew larger than any single heterodoxy in the [[Canon of Heterodoxies|Canon]]. They gained [[House|Houseship]] and later [[Great House|Great Houseship]] if only to lose it all in [[Fall of the Pretender|their fall]] on a [[Quest into Oblivion]] only years later.

### Psionics College

> For more, see [[Psionics College]].

The [[Psionics College]] rose from the ashes of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], and took on their burden of ushering in the [[Psionic Age]]. The agents of the [[College]] are very different than the [[Mystic psionics|mystic psions]] who came before them. They were scholars at heart and took the [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist]] approach like they would with any other field of science. They came to populate the same halls and laboratories as the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fallen]] [[Materialists College]] and took their place as the de facto leaders of the [[Scholars Quarter]] as well.

Now, as of the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]], they are vying to be named the seventh [[Great House]] of the [[Court]] and the first since the Disciples of the Pretender themselves. Their [[psionics]] have made them valuable to the many [[House|Houses]] of the Court and today they have [[Agents of the Psionics College#College tutors|tutors]] employed to the cabinet of nearly every [[Lord Representative]]. Their [[Agents of the Psionics College#College Silencers|Silencers]] walk the streets and [[rayas]] of the [[rota]] completely unseen, relaying information to their clients and making themselves indispensable even to the [[House of the Sun]] and its [[Orator]] herself.

### Muqallid mimics

> For more, see [[Muqallid mimics]].

The only naturally-[[Psionics|psionic]] race of the [[Orior]], the [[Muqallid mimics]] live just as much in the [[Psionic Sphere]] as they do in the [[Prime Material Sphere]]. Their physical forms within the latter are insectoid – covered in protective spikes and retracting blades – but are obscured by a powerful haze of [[Psionics#Hallucination|hallucinations]] and [[psionics#silencing|silencing]]. Their presence slips through gaps in human perception. They are hard to make out and harder to maintain focus on.

They are nomadic wanderers and solitary to a one, occasionally drifting from population center to population center. They are mostly benign observers who are drawn to crowds. They have not been observed eating, drinking, speaking, sleeping, or defecating, and were even theorized to be [[docetic]] upon their discovery in the [[Early Renascence period]].

### Gljiva, the Conquering Fungus

> For more, see [[Gljiva, the Conquering Fungus]].

The [[Gljiva, the Conquering Fungus|Gljiva]] is an aggressively-growing horde of mushrooms and other fungus that possesses a single, highly-[[Psionics|psionic]] mind. It is motivated solely by knowledge and understanding and has conquered large swaths of the [[Known World]] in its pursuits. Everywhere it grows, it covers the terrain and psionically disables, overwhelms, and consumes its native fauna. It has full access to their knowledge and that of their peoples, as well as complete control over the physical forms of the overgrown.

Making itself known in the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]], the Gljiva holds contentious relationships with the races of the [[Orior]]. The forces of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Court]], the scholars of the [[Psionics College]], and a tenuous web of treaties are all that stand in the way of its expansion.

## Classes of human psions

### Mystic psions

> For more on the various classes of the mystic psions, see [[Mystic psionics#Classes of the mystic psions|Mystic psionics > Classes of the mystic psions]].

[[Mystic psionics]] largely died out with the [[Fall of the Pretender|fall]] of the [[Pretender]] and their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]], who pursued lofty and chivalric stations of [[Mystic psionics#Psiknight|Psiknight]] or [[Mystic psionics#Dwaalstepper|dwaalstepper]] or [[Mystic psionics#Illusionist|illusionist]]. Though the [[Agents of the Psionics College|agents]] of the [[Psionics College]] have largely abandoned such frivolities in favor of more modern solutions, there exist a number of psions throughout the wider [[Known World]] who still pursue mystic psionics. They are healers and spiritual guides and warders.

### College tutors

> For more, see [[Agents of the Psionics College#College tutors|Agents of the Psionics College > College tutors]].

[[Agents of the Psionics College#College tutors|College tutors]] are a hot commodity for the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]] and have been employed to the cabinet of nearly every [[Lord Representative]]. They protect their clients from [[psionics#psionic attack|psionic attack]], awaken them to their [[psionics]], and train them in the defense of the mind. They also collect intelligence both for and on their clients, and report back to their masters. The [[Psionics College]] has in effect created an intelligence network rivaling even that of the [[Messengers Guild]].

### College Silencers

> For more, see [[Agents of the Psionics College#College Silencers|Agents of the Psionics College > College Silencers]].

[[Agents of the Psionics College#College Silencers|College Silencers]] are masters of [[Psionics|psionic]] [[Psionics#Silencing|silencing]], whereby people, objects, and events can be hidden from perception by others. They slip through the crowded streets and [[rayas]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] undetected, protecting the secrets of their client [[House|Houses]]. The shady meetings and deals and tristes of the [[Court]] and its [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] are kept concealed by Silencers all under the control of the [[Psionics College]].

### The Overgrown

> For more, see [[Agents of the Psionics College#The Overgrown|Agents of the Psionics College > The Overgrown]].

In the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Court]] are maintaining a tenuous peace with the unrelenting [[Gljiva, the Conquering Fungus]], which has created opportunity for the [[Psionics|psionic]] [[Agents of the Psionics College|agents]] of the [[Psionics College]]. Now, the [[Agents of the Psionics College#The Overgrown|Overgrown]] interface directly with the mind of the Gljiva, giving them a frightening visage but enabling them to access a near unprecedented level of [[psionics|psionic influence]].
