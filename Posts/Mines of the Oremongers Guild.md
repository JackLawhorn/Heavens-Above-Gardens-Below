## Discoveries of the Guild

After the [[Rise of the Oremongers Guild|rising up]] of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[Oremongers Guild#earth shapers|earth shapers]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] sought to test their newfound [[iconic pacts|iconic magics]] in a number of different ways, including by digging deeper into the earth. Starting with a network of shallow tunnels directly under the City, they experimented with different mining methods and depths. They discovered that the deeper the mining, the weaker the connection between the Guild earth shapers and the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]], making it harder to dig deeper using the Guild's iconic magics.

This was explained by their patrons as a result of the [[roiling of the elements]], and the stations that their people had settled into after the taming of the [[Wild Magics]] and the clearing of their [[nyxfire]] storms by the [[Sun Elves]]. Motes deeper in the earth are further from the divine, animating light of [[Ylem]], and have been been dormant for much longer than their neighbors on the surface. As such, they are more passive and unresponsive, and therefore more difficult for the earth shapers to communicate with.

What the agents of the Guild discovered for themselves is that the conscience-like voice of the earth motes – which towards the surface was so loud as to sear their brains at the thought of digging closer to the [[polar onyx deposit|polar onyx deposits]] below – grew quiet at these great depths. The compulsion to commit their great paradoxy against Ylem itself grew harder and harder and eventually impossible to ignore until the Oremongers Guild's eventual [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]] at the start of the [[Crisis of Hubris]].

## Center of Guild mining efforts

### Tunnel network

The [[Oremongers Guild]]'s first mining efforts took the form of a network of shallow tunnels directly beneath [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Initially simple attempts to test their newfound [[iconic pacts|iconic magics]] after the [[Rise of the Oremongers Guild|rising up]] of the City itself, this network still remains as of the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]] and have even been expanded upon throughout the construction of the [[New City]].

In the modern day, these tunnels are used in a variety of different ways. Beneath the [[White Quarter]], [[House of the Sun]] [[House of the Sun#aides|aides]] use the most shallow of these tunnels as routes for making deliveries and quickly traversing the oft-heavily trafficked City streets. The deeper tunnels were converted into the [[Old City]]'s sewer system, which even today is so advanced that it was mirrored in the building of the New City. Most recently, these tunnels were used to lay the wiring for the [[Messengers Guild]]'s doomed [[Messengers Guild#Telegraph network|telegraph network]] in the the [[Later Renascence period]].

### The Maw

> For more, see [[The Maw]].

After the [[The Elf who fell from the sky|fall of the Storm Elf]] from the skies above [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the impact crater created just northeast of its outermost walls was used as a base of operations for the [[Oremongers Guild]]'s mining efforts. From this mine, these efforts bore metals like gold and copper, gems like ruby and sapphire, useful materials like [[wol stone]], and even [[docetic materials]] like [[docetic materials#silver|silver]].

Before its destruction, this mine was the deepest point on the surface of the [[Known World]], practically a city all its own dug straight down into the earth. [[Oremongers Guild#Earth shapers|Earth shapers]] dug slowly down with their magics, and left behind nearly 500 storeys of living quarters for their members, labs for their scholars, training facilities for their warrior class the [[Oremongers Guild#Artificer knights|artificer knights]], and any number of other wonders. A complex pulley system developed by the [[Cult of Pythos]] allowed the Guild to lower down equipment and raise up the materials they produced.

This place would serve as the setting for their [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]], the mine since filled by the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] and remaining as a scar upon the City and all of the Known World.
