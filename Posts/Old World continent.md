The Old World continent is the [[Known World]]'s northernmost landmass â€“ at least of those that have been charted by humanity or the other known races of the [[Orior]]. It was the place where humanity evolved and where it stood up to the light of [[Ylem]], where they came into contact with the [[Elven Legion]] and where they founded their gleaming [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]].

## Geography

The borders of the Old World continent are defined by coastlines to the west and to the south, and by [[extramundane]] borders to the north and to the east. Between these borders sits the [[Valley of Ruins]] which comprises the majority of the continent's charted land area.

To the west, it meets the [[Sink]] at the [[Gold Coast]] along which the [[human clans]] traveled with the [[Sun Elves]] for all of the [[Elven March]]. To the south, it reaches the [[Great Sea]] at the [[Sun Coast]] on which [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] was [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founded]]. Further to the southwest, this sea rounds off to the [[Black Coast]] which can be followed into the [[lands to the south]].

The Old World continent stretches far to the east, but the full scope of this frontier is unknown as it gives way to the treacherous and uncharted [[Astral Wilds]]. Similarly, the [[Deep Deserts]] to the north do not so much as end as much as the [[Prime Material Sphere]] itself fades away into the [[Deep Deserts#mirage|mirages]].
