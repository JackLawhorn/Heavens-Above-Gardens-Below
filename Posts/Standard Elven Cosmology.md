The shape of the [[Nyx]] as explained to the peoples of the [[Known World]] by the [[Sun Elves]] of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]], Standard Elven Cosmology centers around celestial "Spheres" and their overlaps and intersections.

## Spheres of the Nyx

### Astral Sphere

> For more, see [[Astral Sphere]].

The [[Astral Sphere]] is that of [[Ylem]] itself and was – as the [[Griot|Griots]] of the [[Sun Elves]] tell it – the first traces of reality that sprung to existence in the nothingness that became the [[Dragon]]. It's here that the eternal conflict known only as the [[roiling of the Nyx|roiling]] of the [[Nyx]] is waged, though the weapons and soldiers of each side manifest throughout the other Spheres of reality such as the [[Angels]] and the [[Umbral Aspects]] found within the [[Prime Material Sphere]].

All that came after sprung from the Astral Sphere, the influence of which is visible throughout the Prime Material Sphere that humanity and the other races of the [[Orior]] inhabit: light and heat and [[nyxfire]]. The [[Albedo]] that makes up one's [[Albedo#aura|aura]] ties life itself to this [[extra-physical]] Sphere.

### Prime Material Sphere

> For more, see [[Prime Material Sphere]].

The [[Prime Material Sphere]] is that in which humanity and the other races of the [[Orior]] have sprung into being. Formed by a particular overlap of the [[Laws of Power]], it is governed by Space and Time, two of the earliest children of [[Ylem]] and strikes against the [[Dragon]]'s unreality.

On the grandest of scales, this Sphere constitutes all of reality as occupied and experienced by humanity: a universe of galaxies of worlds. In truth, however, it represents an infinitesimally small portion of what we call the [[Nyx]].

### Psionic Sphere

> For more, see [[Psionic Sphere]].

The [[Psionic Sphere]] is an [[extra-physical]] Sphere which manifests as the collective perceived reality of all sentient beings within the [[Prime Material Sphere]]. It was discovered by the first human [[Psion]] – now known only as the [[Pretender]] – in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and further explored throughout the [[Psionic Age]].

Such studies pioneered the field of [[psionics]] and launched the [[Psionics College]] to great prominence in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Court]].

## Intersections of the Spheres

There exist places in the [[Known World]] and across the greater [[Nyx]] where the Spheres intersect and overlap and where the edges between them may even become blurred enough to cross over from one to another. For the [[Ylem]] who govern the [[extra-physical]] Spheres, these intersections are gateways into the Prime Material Sphere. Even when traversal from one to another is not possible, their influence often seeps through.

These gateways are often unstable, lasting only for a short period of time until the movement of the celestial Spheres takes them out of alignment. One such intersection is the northern reaches of the [[Deep Deserts]] of the [[Old World continent]], where the [[Prime Material Sphere]] and the [[Psionic Sphere]] overlap. The [[Deep Deserts#Mirage|Mirages]] lasted only long enough for the [[Pretender]] and their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] to pass through before fading away for over an [[Ages of the Known World|age]].
