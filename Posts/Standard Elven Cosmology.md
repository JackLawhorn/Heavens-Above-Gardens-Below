The shape of the [[Nyx]] as explained to the peoples of the [[Known World]] by the [[Sun Elves]] of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]], Standard Elven Cosmology centers around celestial "Spheres" and their overlaps and intersections.

## Spheres of the Nyx

### Astral Sphere

> For more, see [[Astral Sphere]].

The [[Astral Sphere]] is that of [[Ylem]] itself and was – as the [[Griot|Griots]] of the [[Sun Elves]] tell it – the first traces of reality that sprung to existence in the nothingness that became the [[Dragon]]. It's here that the eternal conflict known only as the [[roiling of the Nyx|roiling]] of the [[Nyx]] is waged, though the weapons and soldiers of each side manifest throughout the other Spheres of reality such as the [[Angels]] and the [[Umbral Aspects]] found within the [[Prime Material Sphere]].

All that came after sprung from the Astral Sphere, the influence of which is visible throughout the Prime Material Sphere that humanity and the other races of the [[Orior]] inhabit: light and heat and [[nyxfire]]. The [[Albedo]] that makes up one's [[aura]] ties life itself to this [[extra-physical]] Sphere.

### Prime Material Sphere

> For more, see [[Prime Material Sphere]].

The [[Prime Material Sphere]] is that in which humanity and the other races of the [[Orior]] have sprung into being. Formed by a particular overlap of the [[Laws of Power]], it is governed by Space and Time, two of the earliest children of [[Ylem]] and strikes against the [[Dragon]]'s unreality.

On the grandest of scales, this Sphere constitutes all of reality as occupied and experienced by humanity: a universe of galaxies of worlds. In truth, however, it represents an infinitesimally small portion of what we call the [[Nyx]].
