In a remote edge of what the humans call the [[Nyx]], but in reality is simply the [[Prime Material Sphere]] and one of many. On a pitiful world, a [[fallen world]] no longer pertinent to the divine plans of [[Ylem]] and its [[Angels]]. Far to the east of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] on the shores of the [[Sun Coast]]. Stranded months from home and now without their most powerful warriors – the [[Oremongers Guild#Artificer knights|artificer knights]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] – [[House Lightbringer]] carries on with their [[Quest into Oblivion]].

_Here, in this untamed and treacherous place, humanity of the [[Known World]] first falls victim to the [[Red Court|Hunger]], child of the [[Dragon]] itself and a scourge upon reality._

---

The noble Captain Torchbearer had not approved of the [[quest]] that her [[House]] and [[Lord Representative|Lord]] insisted was the divine calling of their people. They betrayed their overconfidence by choosing to go east, following the path of the [[Sun Elves]] and their [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March|Post-Heliotropic March]]. The way along the [[Sun Coast]] and around the [[Great Sea]] was unknown, but sure to be long and hard and there could be no certainty of what they would find. And yet she loved and believed in Lord Lightbringer and found herself by his side as he argued this [[Questing Charter]] before the [[Court]]. Only months later, [[House Lightbringer's Questing Charter#The questing party|their questing party]] departed from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

For a year, they cut and slashed their way through untamed wilderness. Attacked by monstrous creatures and unknown illnesses against which they had little defense, the ranks of the Captain's warriors – the Torchbearer paladins – were thinned little by little. Despite their [[House Lightbringer#Extramundane properties and abilities|Elf-like stature]], they were dwarfed in power by the [[Silver Wolves]] and the [[Oremongers Guild#artificer knights|artificer knights]] pledged to their questing party by the other [[Great House|Great Houses]].

Their first catastrophic loss had come with the [[fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] back in the City they had left behind. The dozen artificer knights and their two dozen [[armiger]] squires who the Guild had pledged to this questing party dropped to the ground suddenly. Though they had no way of knowing the source of this attack, the bodies of the victims were broken and mangled, and their screams echoed throughout the surrounding forests. The other warriors amongst the party's ranks found that their blades – to a one forged by the master smiths of the Oremongers Guild – had lost their edges and gone dull. Their armor turned brittle and were covered in long cracks. Only the [[docetic materials#silver|silver]] arms and armor of the Silver Wolves kept their luster.

The months of marching to come were much harder on the questing party of [[House Lightbringer]]. The Torchbearer paladins equipped themselves with new arms and armor forged hastily from what they were able to melt down, and so slashing through the growth was slowed significantly. At first, Lord Lightbringer and his Captain slowed their journey accommodate the crippled agents of the Oremongers Guild, but they were weak and fell quickly in the battles with the [[goblin clans]] that followed. And without their strongest warriors, many other members of the questing party fell alongside them.

Their second catastrophic loss came as hundreds fell ill with a deadly sickness their party came to call [[verdant fever]]. One by one, their warriors were overcome by verdant growth that seemed to consume them from the inside out, until all that remained was a topiary-like mass in the shape of the humans they used to be. Among the infirm was Captain Torchbearer herself, kept alive for months more of marching by her strength of will alone. The last to fall, Lord Lightbringer's insistence on accommodating the needs of his beloved Captain only slowed the questing party further until her death.

By all accounts driven to madness in grief, Lord Lightbringer and the remaining members of his questing party – diminished to little over one hundred fighting men and women – did manage to round the coastline of the Great Sea. As they broke through the brush, they came upon a dazzling sight: a great tree with bark as dark as the [[Nyx]] itself and leaves that appeared as if made of pure gold.

Still several thousand strides from its base, the party came upon its thick and gnarled roots which they found formed unnaturally into a labyrinthine network of tunnels and barriers and steps. After a day of travel through this difficult terrain, the Lord called for camp to be made among the gargantuan roots and a bonfire to be lit as a signal to their comrades in Omphalos, the City of Gardens. The march had been treacherous and he had lost everything in pursuit of these newfound lands, but the promised arrival of a fleet of the [[Shipwrights Guild]] and their fleet of Sink-faring vessels seemed as a miracle.

At last, he could rest and mourn his losses.

The [[Red Court]] awoke from their slumber to a disturbance somewhere within their accursed domain. Looking with one thousand crimson eyes and feeling with ten times as many tendrils, they found a party of mortals had stumbled into the root system of the great [[Nyxblight Tree]]. *At last*, they thought, *some excitement.* 

---

Lord Lightbringer in his tent, the remaining members of his questing party went forth to scout this strange new world they found themselves in. The roots of this great and beautiful tree were as an entire region and biome unto themselves, and the way towards its trunk grew increasingly difficult. They passed flowers with pure white petals and large, blood-red fruits with the sweetest of flesh. Above their heads, the canopy of the tree extended so far outward as to recreate the night.

It was as they explored this potential new home of man that they were met by strange creatures who appeared as if a race of the [[Orior]]. Clad in a coat of fur and with wing-like membranes stretching between their arms and their torsos, their visage was a frightening one to be sure. They seemed weak and sickly, and they ignored efforts to communicate with the [[Elven tongue]] that any such race should have shared. Instead, they emitted only a high-pitched screech which echoed off of the roots around them. Had these poor creatures really come into contact with the Sun Elves and stood up to the light of Ylem?

Visibly skittish and keeping their distance from these outsiders, the creatures suddenly launched an attack against the humans with all their might and an unmistakable desperation. They fought with fangs and daggers shaped from stone – or perhaps petrified wood? The human warriors were able to dispatch them easily, and with their last breaths the fallen seemed almost thankful and as if they were trying desperately to communicate with their killers. They killed two score of these poor creatures with little more than minor scratches to show for it, sent a number of their ranks back towards camp to warn their comrades, and then continued on their journey.

---

*What interesting creatures*, the Red Court thought, *they reek of a familiar nobility.* Seeing with their one thousand crimson eyes that the weak [[Nycter]] would not be enough, they called upon a much older asset of their Court. And as they flexed muscles long dormant, the tendrils of the black, thorny [[nyxblight]] vines themselves writhed and knotted themselves into soldiers that might see greater odds in combat against the intruders.

The [[Nyxblight#Blights|blights]] are a crude tool, but an effective one. Their master watched as they dispatched the remaining survivors of House Lightbringer who had never before seen such a foe. Dead and dying, they came to be attacked from within by the Red Court's [[Hexecraft pacts|hex]]: the [[Red Death]].

When Lord Lightbringer finally left his tent, not having found sufficient rest nor peace from the grief which gripped his heart, it had been days. To his horror, he found himself to be all that remained of his once-noble Great House. Around him, his warriors lay dead and dying, overcome by some horrific illness. Those who had perished seemed the lucky ones for the still-dying were in agony as they begged their Lord for death, their flesh liquified and dripping off their bodies at the points of infection.

Those who had already passed appeared to have their very anatomy warped into forms that were alien and near-incomprehensible. The Lord could not have been certain they were in fact his comrades were they not wearing their faces like ghastly masks and calling out for help with familiar, pained voices. Though these beasts formed of others' flesh and blood seemed rabid, they kept their distance and did not attack him.

Looking up, he saw the great tree for what it was all too late to save the souls of his questing party. What they had thought was its bark was a thick layer of hideous, barbed vines that strangled the tree underneath. The leaves were not a regal gold but a sickly yellow. He had lost his beloved Captain, he had led his comrades into whatever manner of horror this was, but it was this realization that killed the man who had once been known as Lord Lightbringer.

---

With one thousand crimson eyes, now including those of the fallen House Lightbringer, the Red Court watched as a defeated man made the trek alone towards the base of the great Nyxblight Tree. *Predictable*, they thought, *but not mundane. It seems brother [[Fallen Son|Despair]] has claimed yet another. Or is this one to be my new champion?*

The Red Court watched with growing interest, a sensation they had not experienced in [[Ages of the Known World|ages]]. They watched as this mortal Lord journeyed past his dead and dying comrades. They watched as he traversed the labyrinthine root system and up to the base of the Nyxblight Tree. And they watched as he found the portal into the tunnels and chambers below and approached their physical form that lay in wait there.

---

Finally, the man that was once Lord Lightbringer found himself in a massive, dark chamber far below the surface of the [[Known World]] and enveloped in the roots and vines of this accursed tree. There he came upon an overpowering crimson light. And though he knew it to be false light, it seemed blinding there in the all-consuming dark. Coming closer, he found the withered corpse of what appeared to be a Sun Elf of the [[Elven Legion]], and behind it a strange biological mass that seemed to be the source of this light.

*Come, weary traveler,* he heard from deep within his skull, *haven't you suffered long enough?* The man knew he should run from this place, that he should fear whatever force had lured him here. But he also knew the deep and terrible truth that he had already forfeited his life, that he had nothing left to live for. And there was a kind of warmth emanating from this... thing. Having shed his past life, this warmth that felt like a new life, or the opportunity for one.

And so, having nothing left with which to fight against this thing, he reached out his hand towards the mass and accepted his fate.

When the man that was once Lord Lightbringer stepped out from the trunk of the great Nyxblight Tree, he was no longer a mere mortal. His skin was inky black and hard as stone like petrified, knotted wood. His hair had turned to yellowed leaves and tendrils of the thorny, black nyxblight vines wrapping their way around every inch of his body.

Before him stood an army under his command, one with which he shared a visceral connection through the Red Court's accursed magics. Like them, a Hunger strangled his very being, a Hunger that drove them to serve their master. Like any slave, he was shackled here. Champion of his new master, the Red Court. A new [[Red King]] for this new age.

And here, from his throne, he gazed upon the waves of the Great Sea to the west and there he was the sails of three ships. Doubtless the Shipwrights Guild he and his men had signaled, come to aid them and ferry men and supplies to and from Omphalos, the City of Gardens, the voice of the Red Court commanded him to do what he already knew he must.

Such was the second loss of the [[Crisis of Hubris]] that brought about the Red Death period in Omphalos, the City of Gardens.

> [[House Lightbringer]] were heroes in their time and achieved heights that would not be seen again for centuries. They represented the shared dream of the [[human clans]]: to create a new and prosperous place in this world for humans. Their [[Fallen Houses|fall]] teaches us to be weary of the [[Red Court|Hunger]], and not to mistake it for the call of righteous destiny.
