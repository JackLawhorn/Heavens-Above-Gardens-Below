## The Later Crisis of Hubris

The [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] was particularly important in the history of [[psionics]]. This period saw the [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of of the [[Psionic Age]], the rise and [[Fall of the Pretender|fall]] of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] and the rise of the [[Psionics College]] after them.

### Rise and fall of the Pretender

The field of [[psionics]] was first discovered along with the first human [[psion]], now known only as the [[Pretender]]. Their abilities were first studied in secret by a mentor formerly of the [[Materialists College]], then by the [[Silver Wolves]], and finally by the [[Orator]] of the [[House of the Sun]]. At this point, differing perspectives from these parties struggled to define psionic ability as either [[Magics in the Known World|magic]] or science. The Pretender ultimately revealed themself to the populace of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], a [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revelation]] which brought about the [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of what is now called the [[Psionic Age]]: a golden age for the field of [[psionics]] which stretched from the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] through the [[Early Renascence period]].

Under their stewardship and that of their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]], [[mystic psionics]] grew into a sizable [[cults|cult]] larger than any [[Iconic House|heterodoxy]] of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies|Canon]]. Both [[Psionics#Psionic influence|psionic influence]] and [[belief in the Pretender]] spread quickly throughout the human population, and the City itself was quickly transformed by their [[Mystic psionics#illusionist|illusions]]. The Disciples – taking on stations such as [[Mystic psionics#Psiknights|Psiknight]] or [[Mystic psionics#dwaalstepper|dwaalstepper]] or [[Mystic psionics#Illusionist|illusionist]] – pursued [[Quest|quests]] throughout the City and helped to mend the wounds of a people still recovering from the losses of the [[Red Death period]] and the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]] of the [[Materialists College]].

Ultimately, the Pretender and their Disciples [[Fall of the Pretender|fell]] on a [[Quest into Oblivion]], which had led them north along the [[Gold Coast]] and into the [[Deep Deserts]]. With them fell mystic psionics, though not immediately. It would be the rise of the [[Psionics College]] and its [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist]] approach to the field that would overshadow previous approaches.

### Rise of the Psionics College

Out of the ashes of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] rose the [[Psionics College]] whose scholars took an [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist]] approach to the field of [[psionics]] rather than embracing their predecessors' [[mystic psionics|mystic practices]]. Through this new lens, psionics took shape not as a [[Magics in the Known World|field of magics]] but as a field of science that might be explored as any other.

Throughout the [[Renascence]], the [[College]] grew to be one of the greatest and most influential [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]].

## The Renascence period

The [[Renascence]] saw further development of the field of [[psionics]], even after the end of what is now called the [[Psionic Age]], by the scholars of the [[Psionics College]]. This period is remembered for the exploration of the [[Psionic Sphere]], the discovery of [[psychedelia]], the devastation of the [[Dreaming psions]] which brought about the end of the Psionic Age, and of course the rise of the Psionics College to new heights of prominence.

### Exploration of the Psionic Sphere

Much of the [[Early Renascence period]] was spent exploring the [[Psionic Sphere]]. Initially discovered by the [[Pretender]] and their trusted [[Mystic psionics#Psiknight|Psiknights]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], this realm was still a bold new frontier ripe for exploration. Navigation of the Psionic Sphere made possible the improvement of existing [[Psionics#psionic abilities|psionic abilities]] and the development of powerful new ones.

But so too did it hold a number of new psionic threats [[Natives of the Psionic Sphere|native to the Psionic Sphere]]. In the [[Later Renascence period]], the [[Agents of the Psionics College|agents]] of the [[Psionics College]] discovered [[near-life]] beings called [[thoughtform]] which existed only in the perceived reality of those in the [[Prime Material Sphere]]. Later a race of the [[Orior]] –  the [[muqallid mimics]] – were uncovered who are believed to have been blending in with the human population of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] since its very [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founding]].

### Discovery of psychedelia

In the later years of the [[Psionic Age]], the discovery of [[psychedelia]] – substances which altered and expanded the mind – rocked the [[Psionics College]] and its scholars. In affecting perceived reality, psychedelia is able to unlock both new methods of traversing the [[Psionic Sphere]] in which it manifests and new [[psionics#psionic abilities|psionic abilities]] to be wielded by [[Psion|psions]] under their influence.

These were studied and experimented with for precious few years before the threat posed by the [[Dreaming psions]] motivated the [[College]] and the [[House of Vice]] to criminalize such dangerous materials. It wasn't until the [[Later Renascence period]] and the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]] that these studies – albeit much restricted study – began again in earnest.

### Threat and exile of the Dreaming psions

The [[Psionic Age]] that had begun with the [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revelation]] of the [[Pretender]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] was brought to an end along with the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]] by a new [[Psionics|psionic]] threat that would come to be known as the [[Dreaming psions]]. These human [[Psion|psions]] – some of whom had not yet been awakened – had so much [[psionics#psionic influence|influence]] within the [[Psionic Sphere]] that they were able to unleash devastating mass [[Psionics#Hallucination|Hallucinations]] on [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] in their sleep.

Though they were found to have a particularly close connection with the [[Dwaal, the Dreaming State]], few solutions to this problem were found by the scholars [[Psionics College]] in the days and weeks that followed. Ultimately, the dreamers were [[Exile of the Dreaming psions|exiled]] from the City, sequestered in the first towers of what would be the [[College]]'s [[Psionic Telecommunication Network]].

## The Post-Enlightenment Era

Now, in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], the field of [[psionics]] is more prominent than ever. The [[Psionics College]] has risen to such a station in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Court]] that they hold the ear of the [[Orator]] and are vying to be named as the seventh [[Great House]] and the first since the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]].

Elsewhere in the [[Known World]], its greatest psionic threat is rearing its head: [[Gljiva, the Conquering Fungus]]. First gleaned in the visions of the [[Enlightened Orator]], this all-consuming growth spreads throughout this work both in the [[Prime Material Sphere]] and in the [[Psionic Sphere]]. In its wake, entire races of the [[Orior]] and of the [[noble beasts]] have been enthralled under its influence.
