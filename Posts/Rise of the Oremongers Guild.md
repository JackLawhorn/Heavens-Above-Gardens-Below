The elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] that populated the territory of the young [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]] were not known to the [[human clans]]. As a people, they were split into distinct factions and cultures by every waterway and fault line. Though it was a new relationship for humanity to cultivate, the endorsement and advocacy of the [[Sun Elves]] went a long way in cementing that relationship.

There were those among the humans of the [[Elven March]] who had found themselves to possess a particularly strong connection with the earth motes in the [[First parley with the elemental motes|very first parley with the elemental motes]]. Years or perhaps generations later, their descendants – inspired by the tales of their forebearers – came from the smiths of nearly every clan to enter into an [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]] with these motes and later found the [[Oremongers Guild]].

The terms of the [[Pact magics|pact]] were simple. The earth was to be cared for, its soil tilled and verdancy and growth promoted. The Oremongers Guild were the first, greatest advocates for the titular gardens of the City and their efforts will continue into perpetuity under stewardship by the other [[House|Houses]]. The only other stipulation of the earth motes: the [[polar onyx deposit|polar onyx deposits]] under the City were to be protected, left undisturbed under any and all circumstances.

Immediately upon entering into [[Iconic pact of the Oremongers Guild|their iconic pact]], the first mages of the Guild were rocked by a sudden and drastic change in their perceptive abilities. The earth beneath their feet ticked and hummed with vibrations: a chaotic sea of mismatched frequencies like the voices of a vast crowd. They felt gaps in the stone and packed dirt beneath their feed, sensed footsteps from blocks away. But with time they became able to pull out distinct signals from the noise.

The first and greatest works of the Oremongers Guild was the raising up of Omphalos, the City of Gardens itself. The Guild's [[Oremongers Guild#earth shapers|earth shapers]] – its earliest masters of this newfound sense of [[Iconic pact of the Oremongers Guild#Per-medium sensation|per-medium sensation]] – felt the City's many structures and streets already under the earth just waiting to be called forward. And below that – deeper in the heart of the earth – something else, something even more primordial than the [[Known World]] itself. A medium, not like the others they felt. Within it a palpable divinity, a connection to the [[Nyx]]. But just as the thoughts appeared, a warning from the elemental motes seared their minds like a red-hot brand:

_Remember the terms of our pact, humans. The onyx cannot be disturbed, tempting as it may be. This new home of yours sits upon the center of this world. The deposits beneath lock it in its very place in the Nyx. To interfere with it would mean to catastrophe, both for your people and for the wider cosmos. The roiling of the Nyx must not be trifled with._

And so they pushed the very thoughts out of their minds, the mysteries of the Nyx itself saved perhaps for another day.

With little more than their thoughts, it began. As the Guild's iconic mages walked the landscape of the gardens the earth at their feet came to life, forming rough shapes of walls and arches. With a steady guiding hand these initial rough formations were finalized, shaped like wet clay.

The whole process took only days. The white [[wol stone]] native to this region was perfect for this righteous purpose. What the earth shapers built, this great [[rota]] that still stands to this day, was truly brilliant in the light of the recently completed [[Elven Signaltower]]. It was and is a perfect monument to the glory of Ylem, appropriately founded by the poor inheritors of this [[fallen world]].

And then, so much to do in the months that followed. The mass-housing of the clans, still used to their nomadic lifestyle along the Elven March and abiding only to [[cland]] justice. Further mining projects and the development of new smithing techniques to provide for and arm humanity against the threats of this world. The founding of the [[Court]] and later the [[naming of the Great Houses]] to include the Oremongers Guild itself.

And yet, still beneath it all, thoughts of the heart of the Nyx buried deep below this City. Thoughts that threaten the Known World itself. Thoughts that could only ever could have led to their [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]].
