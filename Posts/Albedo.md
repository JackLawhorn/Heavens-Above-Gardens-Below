Albedo is the necessary physical mechanism of magic, describing the manifestation of the light of [[Ylem]] – itself native to the [[Astral Sphere]] – as energy within the [[Prime Material Sphere]]. Albedo manifests in *wells* where the membrane between these who [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Spheres]] is thinnest, taking two primary forms: the [[#aura|auras]] of living creatures and the [[docetic]] forms of the [[Aspect|Aspects]] of Ylem. 

## Aura

One's field of albedo and the anatomical mechanism by which they may use it to wield their magics is referred to as the aura. All magics wielded by the [[Orior]] and by the [[noble beasts]] of the [[Known World]] rely on the flow of albedo into or out of one's aura, and it is this movement that manifests their [[extramundane]] effects.

Just as the flow of a stream or the roiling of the [[Sink]] can carve cliffs and canyons out of stone, the flow of albedo through the aura carves anatomical pathways in the body. These pathways have been found to take different shapes based on the types of magics channeled, though it is unknown if different magics carve differently shaped pathways or if the shapes of the pathways dictate the magics that can be channeled.

Since the [[Renascence]] studies of the [[Psionics College]], some parties of scholars have used an expanded definition of the word "aura" that incorporates [[psionics#psionic influence|psionic influence]] and a variety of other energies – both known and theoretical – that gather around the human body.

### Saturation of albedo

Most living creatures – including humanity who were born without [[organic magics]] of their own – *saturate* their own auras with albedo through external means. A wide variety of actions have been found to saturate albedo within the aura, sometimes referred to as *acts of glory* or *prominence*. Acts of worship, artistic creation, and combat all help to accumulate small amounts of albedo into the aura, even in creatures who do not have magics to channel with such energies.

The [[Sun Elves]] of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]] had no concept of death for the majority of one's albedo is dispersed back out into the [[Nyx]] where it undoubtably continues to contribute towards the great cosmic [[roiling of the Nyx|roiling]] taking place across all of reality. The rest will remain in the organic materials of the deceased, through consumption of those material allows the transfer of that albedo to one's own aura. Through these natural mechanisms, albedo flows throughout the ecosystem of the [[Known World]] and indeed throughout the wider Nyx.

Races of the [[Orior]] and of the [[noble beasts]] who possess organic magics are blessed with a natural well of albedo that bolsters their aura at a consistent *saturation rate*. This is thought to be the blueprint of the [[Angels]] in seeding life throughout the Nyx just as the organic magics themselves are.

### The aura and the magics

For the races of the [[Orior]] and of the [[noble beasts]] who possess [[organic magics]], one's aura serves as a sufficient [[Categorization of magics#source|source]] and anatomical pathways through which albedo travels makes the body an effective [[Categorization of magics#channel|channel]]. [[Materialist magics]] and their offshoots leverage similar mechanisms. Organic material carries with it the magical pathways etched by the flow of albedo long after the life of the original wielder of such magics, making such artifacts effective channels through which mages may expend their own albedo. [[Necromancy]] and particularly the taking on of [[necromantic grafts]] expands on this idea by using fresher raw materials to use these pathways as an extension of one's own aura.

[[Pact magics]] function differently: involving the flow of albedo between two different auras or between one's aura and another, stronger well. In the case of an [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]], albedo flows from a patron [[Aspect]] of [[Ylem]] to the aura of their pact-bound while in [[mutualist pacts]], albedo flows between the auras of two creatures on relatively even footing. [[Hexecraft pacts]] function similarly but leverage the collective might of [[animalcules]] as an army of pact-bound. As with the other magics, however, pacts mechanically function by the flow of albedo into, out of, and between these wells.

## Physical manifestations of albedo

Albedo is the energy of [[Ylem]] within the [[Astral Sphere]] themselves and the many [[Aspect|Aspects]] are the manifestations of Ylem within the [[Prime Material Sphere]]. Ylem is both [[legion]] and the [[monad]], and so the forms of the Aspects are [[docetic]] – physical but made of pure albedo rather than the atomic components of physical matter.

The Aspects can generally be understood as sentient wells of albedo, thin points in the membrane between these two [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Spheres]]. The greatest of the Aspects – the [[nyxfire motes]] who burn with the purest power of Ylem – are holes punched through the membrane between the Spheres themselves, revealing the divinity beyond. Such was also the case with the [[nyxfire]] storms of the [[Wild Magics]], which necessitated the coming of the [[Elven Legion]] to this [[fallen world]] to clean up such [[paradoxy]].

There exist other docetic forms within the [[Known World]] and across the greater [[Nyx]], especially [[docetic materials]] like [[docetic materials#fulgurite|fulgurite]], [[psicrystal]], and [[brimstone]]. These are called *reactive* as they are yielded from the natural turning of the Spheres themselves and as byproducts of the forces of reality. Fulgurite is yielded by the bolts of the nyxfire motes clashing with great friction against the [[Mundial Aspects]]. Psicrystal is yielded by the friction between the Prime Material Sphere an the [[Psionic Sphere]]. Brimstone is the byproduct of [[alchemy]], which approaches paradoxy against the reality of the Nyx itself.

## Visualization and detection of albedo

With the discovery of [[Docetic materials#fulgurite|fulgurite]] – the footsteps of the [[nyxfire motes]] themselves upon the earth – humanity soon had a means of detecting wells of albedo in the environment. It was found that fulgurite crystals were reactive to proximity to the [[Astral Sphere]], and would produce a faint light when held by a creature with a sufficiently saturated aura or even in the vicinity of one with a greater well of albedo.

In the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], fulgurite films were developed which allowed the aura to be seen with the human eye. This enabled the development of what would come to be called modern medicine as it would reveal blocked albedo pathways throughout the human body that are now understood to be symptomatic of any number of physical and spiritual ailments.
