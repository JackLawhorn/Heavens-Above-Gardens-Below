After [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] had been [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founded]] and construction of the [[Elven Signaltower]] was completed, the [[Sun Elves]] continued their [[Elven March|March]] through the [[Known World]] on a divine [[quest]] from the [[Angels]] to tame the last of the [[Wild Magics]] of this [[fallen world]]. This is generally referred to by human scholars as the "Post-Heliotropic Elven March".

## Path of the March

The path of the Post-Heliotropic Elven March was the subject of centuries of speculation by humanity over the [[Later Heliotropic Age]] and the early majority of the [[Crisis of Hubris]]. This speculation was supported only by scarce oral histories of the many races of the [[Orior]] until the remnants of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]] arrived in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and gave their own account.

As was known, they began their journey east along the [[Sun Coast]] in an attempt to march around the [[Great Sea]] rather than travel over it. Cutting through the brush and various armies sent to stop their advance by the forces of the [[Wild Magics]], they eventually arrived at the great [[Nyxblight Tree]] just as the [[House Lightbringer]] would in the early Crisis of Hubris. The presence of the [[Red Court]] and the catastrophe of the [[Red Plague]] to come completely unbeknownst to them, they briefly skirmished with the [[Nycter]] before continuing their journey.

Having rounded the perimeter of the Great Sea, they entered into the [[Lands to the south]]. Northernmost are the [[Beastlands]], a great expanse of seemingly endless frontier where a great many more races of the Orior were afforded time to develop in the chaos of the Wild Magics' [[nyxfire]] storms.

Eventually, they arrived in the [[Great Dark Cold]] at the Known World's furthest point from the light and warmth of the [[Elven Signaltower]]. Here, it is said, is where the [[Fallen world|fall]] of the [[Old World]] began, and all that remains are a land so devoid of the magics and of the light of [[Ylem]] that the [[Sun Elves]] themselves nearly succumbed to the darkness of the [[Dragon]].

## Departure of the Elven Legion

Details of the campaigns of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]] in the [[Great Dark Cold]] at the farthest reaches of the [[Known World]] are unknown to all except the remnants of the Legion and perhaps whatever few inhabitants are able to survive there. The latter, if they indeed exist, have never made themselves known to humanity. The former were more than reluctant to divulge this information to humanity upon their return to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], and their secrets died with them in the early [[Renascence|Renascence period]].

Once their [[quest]] on the Known World was completed, and presumably reunited with the remnants of the [[Sea Elves|Sea]] and [[Storm Elves]], the Legion did what their people have done for untold millennia across an untold number of worlds. Using their [[Organic magics of the Elven Legion|organic magics]], a new gate was opened for a new [[nyxfarer|nyxfaring]] expedition across the [[Nyx]] and to their next divine quest.

### Remnants of the Legion

As with every such expedition, a number of Elves were left behind. These stragglers – the old, the young, the injured, and the sickly – would not have survived the treacherous March across the [[Nyx]] and were needed to close the gate so as do avoid [[paradoxy]] against the [[Laws of Power]].

These remnants of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]], cut off from their people and from the divine [[quest]] that had given them purpose all their lives, were now free to wander the [[Known World]] in search of new purpose. Many, not destined to live long, broke off from the rest and spent the rest of their lives alone. Only those who were but children when the rest of the Legion left this world were destined to make the trek back to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and see what their influence on [[Heliotropic Age|Heliotropic]] humanity had wrought.

Along this journey, the Elves [[First parley with the elemental motes#^0c7414|once again]] encountered the [[Sobek]], and heard of the horrors perpetrated against them by the [[Necromancer Demons]] of the [[Materialists College]]. Together, they entered into the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] side by side – inspiring awe in the humanity of the later [[Crisis of Hubris]] who had only heard stories of the [[Sun Elves]] – and instigated the [[fall of the Oremongers Guild]] by revealing their crimes directly to the [[Orator]] and then to the populace at large.
