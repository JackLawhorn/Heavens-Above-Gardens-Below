The Red Moon refers to the effect of the [[Red Court]] on the moons of the [[Known World]] throughout the [[Red Death period]]. The influence of this powerful [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] cast the light of the [[silver moon]] in a deep blood red color and thrust the [[Lunar Aspects]] into a period of significant unrest.

## Unrest among the Lunar Aspects

To the peoples of the [[Known World]] – and especially those under the patronage of the the [[Lunar Aspects#Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]], [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]] of all the Hunters of the Land – the [[Red Death period]] saw an abrupt disconnection from the [[Lunar Aspects]]. The [[silver moon]] appeared as an ominous sign in the [[Nyx]] above, cast in a deep blood red color, and the [[Aspect]] herself was ominously silent to the pleas of her children.

After the defeat of the [[Red Court]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] by the [[House of the Sun]]'s [[House of the Sun#Daywatch|Daywatch]] and their great [[Burning]], it was revealed to the [[Silver Wolves]] of [[Clan Wolfstepper]] what the cause of her silence had been. In conquering the City, the Red Court had been able to entrap the Wolf Mother within within their own extra-physical [[Red Court#Sphere of the Red Court|Sphere]]. There, she was suffered to battle non-stop with the horrors of the Red Court. These battles weakened the Wolf Mother significantly and she was not able to rise again to her previous power. These long-lasting effects ultimately sped the prophesized coming of the [[Luminary]], which necessitated the [[New Silver Age]] and the [[fall of the Silver Wolves]].

## Berserkers of the Red Moon

Cut off from their [[iconic pacts|patron]] [[Aspect]], the human children of the [[Lunar Aspects#Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]] – [[Clan Wolfstepper]] – not only suffered through that silence and abandonment but also found themselves afflicted with a newfound aggression, ferocity, and bloodlust. During the [[Red Death period]], a new faction arose from this people: the Berserkers of the Red Moon. Although the influence of the Red Moon made them extremely effective [[Apotropaics]] who played a significant role in the [[Campaigns against the Red Court|campaigns]] against the [[Red Court]], they are also remembered as criminals who abused their station and leveraged it to run a sizable, organized protection racket out of the refugee camps of the [[Barony of Stilts]].
