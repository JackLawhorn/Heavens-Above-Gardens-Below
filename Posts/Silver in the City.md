After the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of the [[Silver Wolves]] which closed out the [[Crisis of Hubris]], all of [[Clan Wolfstepper]] – and their [[Iconic pacts|patron]] [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]], the [[Wolf Mother]] – was made to suffer the consequences. In what is now called the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves#taking of the Silver|taking of the Silver]], the Clan's [[silver]] reserves were seized by the [[House of the Sun]], melted down in the forges of the treasury, and spread throughout [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] such that they may never be recovered in their entirety.

The vast majority of [[Clan Wolfstepper]]'s [[silver]] reserves were used to mint a new lowest denomination of [[Currencies of the City|currency]] or, more accurately, three new denominations: the [[Currencies of the City#silver|silver coins, hastas, and crescents]].

These measures were taken with dual goals in mind. First, dividing the silver into so many small pieces ensured that it would be impossible to recover in its entirety – a priority for the petty, scorned [[Orator]] of the [[House of the Sun]]. Second, this major infrastructure project would help to bolster the economy of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] as humanity entered into a new [[Renascence]] age.

## Defenses in the City

One major project of the [[Reconstruction]] that followed the [[Red Death period]] was the fortification of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] against threats like the [[Red Court]] in the future. These [[Reconstruction#New defenses in the City|new defenses]] invariably incorporated [[silver]] into their design as the [[docetic materials|docetic material]] not only felled the [[Red Death|infected]] beasts but was effective at warding them away. No [[soldiers of the Red Court]] may pass through the gates or over the walls built during this time.

## Silver trinkets and baubles

What [[silver]] wasn't divided into the [[Currencies of the City#silver|silver coins, hastas, and crescents]] or used to fortify the [[walls and gates of the City]] during [[Reconstruction]] ended up in the hands of the many [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]] or in the homes of the citizenry.

For the [[College|colleges]] of the [[Scholars Quarter]], the [[extramundane]] properties of the [[docetic materials|docetic material]] were exciting subjects of study or could be made into masterfully crafted instruments. For the [[Jurisweard]] and the various warrior classes that protected [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] from external threats, the silver was used for the arms and armor of their ranks. And for the [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] and the rest of the [[Class and caste in the City|upper classes]], their homes and offices would come to be adorned with jewelry and sconces and even utensils of silver.

## Reclamations of Clan Wolfstepper

For [[Clan Wolfstepper]] within the walls of the [[Argent Ghetto]], the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves#taking of the silver|taking of the silver]] was an unconscionable defiling of the [[Iconic pacts|patron]] [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]]. Many children of the Clan believe that – even after the betrayal of the [[New Silver Age]] – the [[Wolf Mother]] might be made to return to them if they are able to reclaim and amass a suitable amount of their people's [[silver]].

As early as the first working licenses were granted, small amounts began making their way back into the hands of its former owners in one way or another. [[Argent Ghetto#Beggars of Clan Wolfstepper|Beggars]] line the walls and gates of the ghetto, bringing home precious few [[Currencies of the City#silver|silver crescents and hastas]] for their efforts. Thieves – both children of Clan Wolfstepper and those willing to donate or sell their takings to them – bring in larger trinkets and baubles taken from the houses of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s upper classes.

Once back within the Argent Ghetto, they invariably find their way to the [[Argent Ghetto#cland silversmiths|cland silversmiths]] whose forges produce new items of worship and whose basements become community shrines. This role is one played in secret and whose continuance relies on the discretion of others. Many raids by the [[Jurisweard]] and their [[Bloodhounds]] have been launched upon these holy sites.
