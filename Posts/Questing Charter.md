A Questing Charter is a formal sponsorship of a [[quest]] by the [[Court]] and its [[Great House|Great Houses]], funding the resources necessary to undertake the initiative. The most common Questing Charter requests brought before the [[House|Houses]] of the Court are built around the funding and creation of a [[Great Works|Great Work]] of some kind.

In the [[Later Renascence period]], Questing Charters would be granted to a number of [[House|Houses]] looking to found a colony outside of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]]. Collectively, the Houses behind these settlements would come to be known as the [[Questing Houses]].

## Acquiring a Questing Charter

Before arguing their Questing Charter before the [[Court]], a [[House]] will undergo a period of exploratory research into the supplies needed to undertake the [[quest]] in question. If the proposed initiative involves the creation of a [[Great Works|Great Work]], this would typically mean working with the artists of the [[Mouseion]], builders of the [[Architects Guild]], or other relevant stakeholders to estimate the cost and timeframe. During this period, most Houses will also shop around for support from other groups, especially from the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] whose Court majority simplifies gaining support later on.

The [[Lord Representative]] of the House will submit a request to argue the Questing Charter. This will ensure that an upcoming session will be allocated to this process. The queue for requested matters of the Court is often months long.

During the session itself, the requesting Lord Representative will give an opening argument after which other Houses of the Court have the opportunity to voice their support or any arguments against. After the opening argument and initial feedback, concerns may be responded to and concessions made in order to seek greater support.

After this back and forth, the [[Orator|Orators]] deliberate and come to a decision on whether sponsorship is appropriate. Charters are largely granted as long as a majority of the Houses do not raise issue, but this can mean that [[Union|Unions]] like the Canon can act as influential bottlenecks in this process. In cases where the Questing Charter does not meet this threshold, the support found in Court can often lead to the project being completed even without official sponsorship by the Great Houses. Certain types of Charters do not have this option available to them, however, including the founding of a [[Questing Houses|chartered colony]].
