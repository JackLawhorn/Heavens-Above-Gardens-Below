[[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] was built around the [[Elven Signaltower]], and radiating outward from its base is a great urban layout called the [[rota]], a radial grid of streets. Along main streets, called [[rayas]], are the major political and industrial entities, between which lay more densely packed residential areas. They are wider, with additional lanes to accommodate more vehicles and pedestrian traffic. Territory along the rayas and closer to the Signaltower is highly sought after.

The rota is not a full circle because the Signaltower was built on the [[Sun Coast]]. Its southern sector expands beyond into the [[Sink]] itself, where in the [[Crisis of Hubris]] the [[Fisher Barons]] built up the [[Barony of Stilts]] suspended above the waves.
