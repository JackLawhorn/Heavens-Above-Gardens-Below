The Moon-Touched are a rare, natural phenomena of the [[Nyx]] and its children the [[Lunar Aspects]]. Themselves the children of one of the Lunar Aspects, they are born of a race of the [[Orior]] but possess strange [[extramundane]] properties.

The most infamous example of this phenomenon in recorded history is the [[Luminary#Prophesy of the Luminary|long-prophesized]] [[Luminary]] whose imminent coming inspired the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of the [[Silver Wolves]] and the founding of the [[New Silver Age]].

## Moon-Touched in the population

The [[Lunar Aspects#The White Owl|White Owl]] produces far more Moon-Touched in the races of the [[Orior]] than the [[Wolf Mother]], and it is thought that the rate at which this phenomenon occurs is inversely proportional to the size of the [[Lunar Aspects]]. Though little is known of the [[Lunar Aspects#<strike>The Fallen Son</strike>|Fallen Son]], who now slumbers far below at the very bottom of the [[Sink]], he would theoretically produce fewer still.

Though as children of the [[Lunar Aspects]] they are divine phenomena in their own rights, the births and lives of the Moon-Touched have been largely inconsequential throughout recorded history. They often become leaders of worship and culture. In some races of the Orior, their appearance is read as a sign from the [[Nyx]] of times of hardship or prosperity or of particularly significant events.
