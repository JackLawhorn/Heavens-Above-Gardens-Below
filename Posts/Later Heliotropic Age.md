A period of human history beginning with the [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and ending with the [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild]] and the [[Crisis of Hubris]] it heralded in. This period is also referred to as the First Golden Age of humanity.

## Proliferation of culture and industry

Shedding their nomadic lifestyle after untold generations along the [[Elven March]], human culture and industry flourished in the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]. During this period, the [[human clans]] embraced new opportunities while still maintaining a degree of separation from the others.

It was common for each clan to have their own hunters, smiths, and other tradesfolk. Other industries were reliant on specific [[iconic pacts]] with certain patrons – such as that of the [[Oremongers Guild]] with the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]]. In these cases, the pact-bound most commonly came from a number of disparate clans – just as the first [[Silver Wolves]] had hailed from their own clans – and then formed their own [[House|Houses of the Court]].

### Industry

The [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founding of the City]] required massive infrastructure projects that would come to be known as the first [[Great Works]]. Heading many of these projects were the [[Oremongers Guild]], whose [[Oremongers Guild#earth shapers|earth shapers]] commanded roads, structures, and the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] walls themselves to rise up out of the earth.

The [[Fisher Barons]] quickly established their operations along the [[Sun Coast]] and would later found their [[Barony of Stilts]], a major hub of industry and home to the [[Barony of Stilts#Embassy Quarter|Embassy Quarter]] and the consulates of the [[Orior]], the [[Barony of Stilts#Great Sea Bazaar|Great Sea Bazaar]], and the [[Barony of Stilts#Shipwrights Quarter|Shipwrights Quarter]]. The City's titular gardens created massive botanical and agricultural industries that employed nearly a quarter of the human population and produced a significant portion of their food supply. Later, this produce would lead to the invention of wines, coffees, and oils as well.

Now sedentary, less portable goods and objects of leisure also gained a significant amount of popularity.

### Scholarship

Now out from under the protection of the [[Sun Elves]], humanity was eager to learn as much as they could about the [[Known World]] and find sources of power that they could take for themselves. The founding of the [[Scholars Quarter]] was one primary means to that end.

Comprised initially of the bards college known as the [[Mouseion]] and the [[Materialists College]], the Quarter would grow to accommodate the [[Philosophers Guild]], the [[Cult of Pythos]], the juggernaut that was the [[Psionics College]], and a number of smaller colleges.

These institutions did not teach the trades of industry, which fell under the jurisdiction of the tradesfolk themselves. Instead, apprenticeship was a more common form of education in adolescents unless they were pursuing a career in bardistry, scholarship and philosophy, or politics.

### Questing culture

Inspired by their mentors the [[Sun Elves]], humanity developed a culture of declaring and pursuing quests of various sizes and significance. Some were industrial or artistic, such as the [[Great Works]] that populate the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]. Others were political such as [[House Lightbringer's Questing Charter]]. Even the realm of [[Sports in the City|sports]] was heightened by the quests of its teams and players, and the audience enjoyed epic tales playing out in front of them.

## Human contact with the Orior

Throughout the [[Elven March|Elven March period]], humanity had only come into contact with two other races of the [[Orior]]: the [[Elven Legion]] and the [[Akụm]] marauders who raided their camps along the [[Gold Coast]]. Relatively soon upon the construction of the [[Elven Signaltower]], humanity came into contact with a number of others.

The first were the alien [[Oklop]] and their consortiums which formed a kind of protective barrier along the [[Sun Coast]]. As the relationship between these two peoples flourished, the [[Great Sea Bazaar]] became a major hub of commerce in the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]].

## The founding of the Court

No longer walking one in front of the other along the [[Elven March]], the [[human clans]] quickly founded the [[Court]] as the form of government in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Within this system, clans and other political entities are afforded [[House|houseship]] and these Houses hold Court overseen by representatives called [[Orator|Orators]] who hail from a number of [[Great House|Great Houses]].

### Law and justice

> For more, see [[Law and justice in the City]]

A chaotic and hectic place in the Later Heliotropic Age, the [[Court]] was quick to establish some form of law and order in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Rising to meet this need was the [[Jurisweard]]: a loose [[Union]] of [[House|Houses]] – typically with some warrior class – with special powers to enforce the Laws of the Court. During this period, this most prominently featured the following factions:

- [[House Lightbringer]] and their Torchbearer Knights
- [[Clan Wolfstepper]] and their [[Silver Wolves]]
- The [[Oremongers Guild]] and their Artificer Knights
- Paladins of the [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]], predecessors of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]]
- The [[Mercenary Corps]] which comprises sellswords hailing from nearly all the [[human clans|clans]]
