The Fisher Queens are one of the oldest [[cland]] [[House|Houses]] and are of [[Rookish clans#Rookish heritage|Rookish heritage]]. They have formed [[Mutualist pacts]] with the water birds of the [[Gold Coast|Gold]] and [[Sun Coast|Sun Coasts]], including diving birds like cormorants and pelicans and wading birds like herons and spearbills.

## Industry: fishing

The first human fishers were the early [[Rookish clans|Rooks]], leveraging the bow and arrows they had developed for shallow water fishing in rivers and in coastal waters.

Later, those Rooks in pacts with the water birds specifically developed many of the fishing instruments used today. Inspired by the hooked beaks of the cormorants, the Fisher Queens developed barbed instruments like fishing hooks and harpoons, and the gullets of pelicans gave way to the first fishing nets.

### Stiltwalkers

Perhaps most iconic to the Fisher Queens is the stiltwalkers, inspired by the long legs and piercing beaks of the spearbills. The stiltwalkers traverse the shallow, coastal waters with their wading spears hunting fish and shrimp and eels.

These stiltwalkers would go on to found the [[Duchy of Stilts]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].
