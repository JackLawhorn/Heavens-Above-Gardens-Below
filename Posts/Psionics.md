Psionics is the extension of the mind past average, mundane ability through a connection to an [[extra-physical]] [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Sphere]] called the [[Psionic Sphere]]. By accessing, traversing, interacting with, and manipulating the Psionic Sphere – a field that envelopes all sentient beings – sorcerers called *[[Psion|psions]]* are able to unleash powerful [[extramundane]] forces.

## Connection to the Psionic Sphere

At the core of psionic phenomena and abilities is the intersection of the [[Prime Material Sphere]] and the [[extra-physical]] [[Psionic Sphere]]. The latter is perceived reality itself and therefore the two [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Spheres]] influence – and are influenced by – each other. A [[Psion]]'s power or "[[#Psionic influence|influence]]" is directly tied to their connection to the Psionic Sphere.

### Psionic influence

One's psionic influence is constantly fluctuating: accumulating over time and being expended by the [[Psion]] to either observe or manipulate the [[Psionic Sphere]]. This influence is easily perceivable by psions of sufficient ability and has even been described as captivating and hard to ignore. Similarly, a psion of sufficient ability might be able to hide their influence from others who might notice, a practice common in the [[House]] [[Agents of the Psionics College#College Silencers|Silencers]] of the [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] of the [[Court]].

### Psionics versus the magics

The scholar psions of the [[Psionics College]] have – since initially breaking off from the [[Mystic psionics]] practiced by [[Disciples of the Pretender|the Pretender and their Disciples]] – argued that it is incorrect to understand psionics as a [[Magics in the Known World|field of magic]]. It more closely resembled, they pointed out, a field of [[the objective|objective scientific study]].

Their primary argument was that psionic abilities draw from the [[Psionic Sphere]] rather than from [[Albedo]] and [[Ylem]]. The Spheres outlined in the commonly accepted [[Standard Elven Cosmology]] model are not [[Aspect|Aspects]], rather concrete forces and laws of nature. To observe the Psionic Sphere may be no more than an additional sense just as the mundane senses observe the [[Prime Material Sphere]]. And all sentient beings manipulate the Psionic Sphere – which is nothing more than perceived reality – so psionic manipulation may not be truly [[extramundane]] either.

### Training in psionics

As a consequence of being [[#Psionics versus the magics|closer to a field]] of [[the objective|objective scientific study]] than to a [[Magics in the Known World|field of the magics]], psionics can be taught to nearly any human and thought to be extendable to other races of the [[Orior]], [[noble beasts]], and possibly even simple beasts. Now, in the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]], many of the warrior classes of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and of the [[colonies of the questing houses|colonies]] of the [[Questing Houses]] are trained in simple psionic practices which aid them in combat. Such services are made available by the [[Psionics College]] – for a fee of course – which has contributed to their rise in prominence throughout human politics and society.

## Psionic abilities

Psionic abilities themselves are the observation or manipulation of the [[Psionic Sphere]], which manifest in the perceived reality of those who live within the [[Prime Material Sphere]]. Psions expend [[#Psionic influence|influence]] in order to perform such abilities, and each is studied intently by the the [[Psionics College]] as a scholarly subfield.

### Accessing the Psionic Sphere

The most common use of psionics by far is to simply access the [[Psionic Sphere]] in order to observe and traverse it. In doing so, a [[Psion]] is able to perceive the reality of those around them, see from their point of view, and access valuable information in other corners of their minds. This might be used to see through the eyes of a suspect in an apartment upstairs or even to see a memory or dream of another.

There exist a number of distinct areas within the Psionic Sphere, including [[Psionic Sphere#Dwaal, the Dreaming State|Dwaal, the Dreaming State]] and the [[Psionic Sphere#Kingdom of Memory|Kingdom of Memory]], and traversing there unlocks access to a number of psionic subfields.

### Hallucination

Hallucination is a field of psionics that involves the creation and manifestation of sensory illusions which exist within the [[Psionic Sphere]] and not within the [[Prime Material Sphere]]. These illusions appear real to those with limited psionic ability, though greater psionic influence is required to manifest illusions that are more realistic or that hold up to closer inspection. As a rule of thumb, manifestation scales in difficulty based on how many senses are being fooled by the illusion. A particularly strong [[Psion]] might be able to enthrall a single person within a complete and self-sustaining illusion.

Generally, a psion's ability to recognize an illusion as unreal is greater than that of someone who is untrained in psionics. This ability also grows with their ability to create them. Two psions on relatively even footing in this subfield might be able to create illusions convincing enough to fool the other at a glance, but will falter under closer inspection. Once the illusory nature of a hallucination is discovered, most psions are quickly able to deconstruct them within the Psionic Sphere and end their influence on those within the Prime Material Sphere.

#### Psionic communication

Psionic communication describes non-verbal communication through psionic means. The range and quality of transmission is limited only by the [[#psionic influence|influence]] of the [[Psion]], so this technique also enables immediate telecommunication. Psionic communication is simply the manifestation of an auditory hallucination, and a more powerful psion is able to limit the perception of the communication to intended targets. Though the use of auditory illusions are most common, more powerful psions can get messages across using the other senses. Psions can communicate via visual flashes quite effectively.

One tool the [[Psionics College]] has kept for itself is its [[psionic telecommunication network]]: a hexagonal grid of towers constructed around [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] which drastically increases the range from which messages can be psionically transmitted.

#### Psionic attack

Officially denounced by the [[Psionics College]] and criminalized by [[Orator]] and her [[Court]], the overloading of the senses was proven to be an extremely effective form of torture. Affecting the mind rather than the form, sensory torture can disorient with rapid-fire flashes of sensation, prolonged exposure to particular sensations, or direct manipulation of the pain receptors or even the subject's perception of time.

Psionics can also be used to easily disable an opponent. While simple [[#Hallucination|illusions]] might distract or disorient, more complete ones are able to effectively enthrall a victim in an artificial reality. A small number of psions have displayed the ability to manipulate a mind's perception of time, which even more effectively disables the target.

### Attention and recognition

#### Silencing

Silencing is the field of psionics centered around removing – either partially or completely – sensory stimuli from the perceived reality of the [[Psionic Sphere]]. This relies primarily on the effect of lacking recognition or inability to hold attention, which is called "agnosia". Partial silencing can remove identifying features from people, objects, and even the surrounding environment. Even when actively observed, partially silenced subjects can be difficult to recognize or visually track. When not actively observing one's surroundings, they fade into the crowd or background and can hide in plain sight.

Silencing is commonly used to walk through the densely populated urban sprawl of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] undetected and even to protect sensitive conversations between [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] of the [[Court]]. Occasionally, agents of the [[Psionics College]] called [[Agents of the Psionics College#College Silencers|Silencers]] are called upon to silencing larger, more conspicuous events from public view in the name of keeping the peace.

Similar to the psionic field of Illusions, the effectiveness of silencing increases exponentially the more stimuli are being masked. Even so-called "complete" silencing can be recognized by the most powerful of psions. This is because the [[#psionic influence|influence]] required to silence each sense, as well as the level of specificity needed to remove all context information from the environment is immense.

#### Captivation

Captivation sits opposite silencing: a field of psionics centered around lending added [[#psionic influence]] to a person or object in order to make them more likely to attract the attention of those around them. Captivation is effective in creating a distraction that drags prying eyes off of other, more sensitive goings-on to point in another direction, captivating a crowd before public announcement is delivered, or to use [[psionic suggestion]] to more effectively barter with an information broker.

[[Psionic suggestion|Suggestion]] is a subset of the psionic field of captivation centered around adding greater psionic influence to a written or verbal message or some other communication. It can be used to enhance one's persuasive or deceptive abilities and to increase their perceived authority. That being said, suggestion cannot force a subject to comply with a command.
