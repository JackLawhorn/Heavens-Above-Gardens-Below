Relatively unaffected by the [[Wild Magics]] that ravaged the surface, the Sink is an ancient and alien world. There, strange creatures and phenomena exist that have never been, and may never be, experienced by the races of the surface world.

## Akụm frenzies

Disciples of the sleeping god – the [[Lunar Aspects#<strike>The Fallen Son</strike>|Fallen Son]] who crashed down from his mother the [[Nyx]] to his resting place in the depths – the [[Akụm]] are all the remains of a tragic tale of his hubris. Grotesque, starved hunters of the sea, they are coastal marauders who hunt in frenzies.

Born of the great predators of the Sink, they can sense the blood of their prey at great distances and dispatch them with razor-sharp teeth. Cursed by their lineage, they are unable to rest and must continue their eternal hunt from birth to death.

## Oklop consortiums

The [[Oklop]] are a race of heavily armored aquatic scavengers that form loose consortiums along the many coastlines of the [[Known World]]. Extremely biodiverse as a result of generations lived in the twilight between the surface and the depths, Oklop vary greatly in anatomy. They have wide builds and flat heads sporting eyes as inky-black as the deep ocean.

Oklop are a mostly self-involved race, but have increasingly partaken in trade with humans who have much need for their ability to scavenge undersea caves, ruins, and wrecks. Not at all interested in monetary incentive, the Oklop work instead for a range of wildly different human trinkets and bobbles which they bury in secret to create vast, private hoards.

## Reef Knights

Formed of coral, the living stone of the Sink, the [[Reef Knights]] are exulted by inspiration from the armies of the [[Sea Elves]]. One of the few deep sea races of the [[Orior]], the Reef Knights are wandering paladins, followers of [[Ylem]]. They are most similar to the [[Verdant Knights]] of the [[Astral Wilds]]. Mostly, the Reef Knights are hyper-fixated on a sole all-consuming quest.

The color of their coral armor varies greatly and can be altered at will and in response to environmental stimuli. The coral itself is constantly in a state of rapid growth, and their movements can be understood as a mass of coral mimicking the upright shape of the Sea Elves in real-time. They are slow, especially when above the sea, but are proficient in a great many [[Combat Arts]], especially wielding spears and lances. They are walking, self-sustaining ecosystems and home to a great many species of simple beasts, as well as the majority of the Sink's [[Noble beasts]]. They hold a relationship with each of these creatures similar to a [[mutualist pacts|mutualist pact]].
