After the [[Red Death period]] and the [[Long Daylight]] that humanity subjected all of the [[Known World]] to, many pilgrimages were undertaken by many races of the [[Orior]] to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Elven Signaltower]]. To a one, these peoples had risen up to the light of [[Ylem]] by coming in contact with the [[Sun Elves]] on their [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March|Post-Heliotropic March]], and so they had heard legends of the humans and their great tower that housed the sun of the Known World itself.

They brought with them stories of the Known World, of the places they came from and had traveled through. Each had legends of their own of contact with the Sun Elves, the last of whom were now gone. They brought their own strange [[organic magics]] and [[Pact magics|pacts]] that were studied thoroughly by the [[House of the Sun]] and the many [[scholars of the City]].

These first visitors played a significant role in establishing the now-prominent [[Barony of Stilts#Embassy Quarter|Embassy Quarter]] in the [[Barony of Stilts]]. Today, in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], there exist a great many peoples and cultures in the City which trace their roots back to pilgrimages in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and [[Early Renascence period]].
