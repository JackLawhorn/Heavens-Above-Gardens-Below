The Mundial Aspects are foundational, elemental motes of water, earth, and wind which govern the [[Known World]], and their direct progeny: the many [[#motes of the landscapes]]. Their children greatly bolster the ranks of the [[Minor Aspects]], including the oldest and greatest among them: the [[Giants]].

## Elemental motes

### Water motes

Everything about the element of water is determined by eternal Cycles, including the rising and falling of the tides, as well as the evaporation, condensation, and precipitation that all water motes undergo and which forms their understanding of the passage of time.

Within these Cycles, water motes traverse large distances and take on many forms, some of which are considered exalted states. To float above the surface and nearer to the Nyx in the form of steam or clouds, to climb mountains as river water or to blanket the summits as snow, and especially to reclaim territory from the [[#earth motes]] are all especially coveted opportunities.

Though separated into different seas, rivers, and other bodies of water in the minds of the humans, the water motes do not consider such boundaries because of their ties within the Cycles. Differences in culture, disposition, and form still exist between regions, as with all motes, so it is still important to take note of these factors when dealing with them.

Water is an aggressive element, which has led to complex relationships with other motes. They are most amenable to [[#wind motes]], which allow them to take forms which may rise above the surface. Since the arrival of the [[Lunar Aspects#<strike>The Fallen Son</strike>|Fallen Son]] at the bottom of the Sink, water has become distant from the [[nyxfire motes]]. Of course, the water and the earth are forever locked in eternal conflict over territory.

### Earth motes

The earth of the [[Known World]] is nearly as old as the waters of the [[Sink]], and in fact used to be more fluid like its counterpart. In order to lay down stakes and claim its own territory, it went on to fortify itself against the forces of the sea and form great plates, upon which continents would rise from volcanic activity. The earth motes consider this a great moment in their history, inspired by the fortification of the [[Angels]] themselves against the [[Glossary/Dragon]].

The earth motes have established a more or less neutral relationship with the [[#wind motes]] after ages of warfare. Some territories, especially in deserts, do still see conflict between these two elements. They are still and will forever be locked in eternal conflict with the [[#water motes]], whose seas and rivers separate the earth into different territories. This culminates in conflict at the shorelines and riverbanks, but has also led to segregation and conflict between different regions of the earth as well.

Of all the elements, and out of necessity, the earth is the most rigid in its form. Because of this, opportunities and processes for transformation are coveted. Of particular importance are the [[skylands]] and mountains where these motes are constantly reaching upwards towards the [[Nyx]], fertile areas where the earth is able to bear flora, volcanic areas where expansion occurs, and [[Docetic materials#onyx|onyx]] deposits within the earth which lock the world in its place in the Nyx.

### Wind motes

The wind motes take a largely intangible form and tend to reside far above the realm of the [[Orior]], so significantly less is known about them compared to the [[#water motes|water]] and [[#earth motes]]. They are known to be allies to the [[Storm Elves]] in their campaigns against the [[Giants]] and their [[Giants#Empire of Dyēus|Empire of Dyēus]], but have rarely converse with humans.

On the surface, they are most densely populated in regions and biomes such as plains, deserts, and canyons. They have entered into a kind of peace with the water and earth motes after the [[Roiling of the elements]] was brought to an end by the [[Sun Elves]].

## Children of the elemental motes

### Motes of the landscapes

From the earth sprang the mountain and hill motes, water birthed the sea motes, and the air brought to life the cloud motes. In the eternal conflict known as the [[roiling of the elements]], the interactions of these motes also birthed new progeny.

The descendants of the earth and water motes include the lake, river, coast, and island motes. Water and air birthed the rain and cloud motes, and earth and air brought the grasslands and the [[skylands]]. To enumerate the motes of the landscapes would be to put words to all of the natural wonders of the [[Known World]].

### The Minor Aspects

The children of the [[#motes of the landscapes]] themselves are the [[Minor Aspects]], lesser than the Mundial Aspects in power and scope of domain. They govern natural phenomena and all that occurs within the [[Known World]] and to its inhabitants.

The oldest and most powerful of the Minor Aspects are the [[Giants]]. In the early ages of [[prehistory]], it is said that two Giant twins took turns holding up the sky. The sole offspring of these [[Giants#Foundational Giant myth|foundational Giants]] was Aker, Aspect of the Horizon who wrested control of the sky and founded the [[Giants#Empire of Dyēus|Empire of Dyēus]]. Now, an entire race of Giants fights a war there against the [[Storm Elves]], having all but abandoned their domains on the surface.
