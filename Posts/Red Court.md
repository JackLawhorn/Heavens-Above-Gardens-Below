The Red Court is the [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] of Hunger which has settled deep within the root systems of the massive [[Nyxblight Tree]] on the eastern bank of the [[Great Sea]]. In the [[Prime Material Sphere]], it appears as a crimson, bioluminescent mass that itself is incapable of attack, defending itself, or even movement. Nevertheless, [[#Magics of the Red Court|its powerful magics]] have devastated multiple species of [[Noble beasts]] and [[Orior]] alike, being most infamous for ushering in the dark time known as the [[Red Death period]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

## Draconic heritage

The Red Court and all its siblings – the [[Umbral Aspects]] – descend from the [[Dragon]] itself and are the children of its [[Vestiges]]. Specifically, the divine strikes of the [[Angels]] that rent [[Entropy]] in twain created both Hunger and its twin [[Anōmalos|Wrath]]. Just as reality itself pains the unreality of the Dragon, the Umbral Aspect of Hunger we call the Red Court will not be satiated as long as there is fuel to consume.

## Magics of the Red Court

### Hexecraft

Most prominent among the magics of the Red Court are the [[Hexecraft pacts]]. Hexes leverage the flow of [[albedo]] from one's [[aura]] and throughout the body to inflict dramatic physical and spiritual mutilations and transformations onto their victims. The [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] uses these mechanisms to [[#The Red Death|spread]] the [[Red Death]], to transform its victims into [[#Apex Vectors]] and other forms of its soldiers, and to forge the connections between them and the [[#Sphere of the Red Court]].

### Sphere of the Red Court

Despite its meek manifestation within the [[Prime Material Sphere]], the Red Court has been able to leverage the immense [[albedo]] siphoned from the [[Hexecraft pacts]] it has forced upon its victims to generate an extra-physical [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Sphere]] of its own. Or perhaps the Sphere predates its hexecraft, some pocket between reality saturated with and ultimately colonized by the idea of the primordial Hunger itself.

Both its soldiers and its victims – who in truth are one and the same – are connected to this sphere via the Red Court's powerful [[psionic]] abilities. This connection links those infected by its Hunger over long distances, and allows the [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] to relay specific communications, commands, and objectives.

No human eyes have bore witness to this accursed place without succumbing to its corruptive influence and becoming one of its soldiers, save for the [[Red King]] who was once called [[Fall of House Lightbringer|Lord Lightbringer]].

### Connection to the Nyxblight

A common sight wherever an [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] or its influence can be found, the thorny, black [[Nyxblight]] vines are a rot upon the [[Known World]] and the reality of the [[Nyx]]. Curiously, however, they do appear to have some particular connection to the Red Court more so than to its siblings. Its den deep within the root systems of the [[Nyxblight Tree]] has the greatest density of this overgrowth ever reported in the Known World.

Moreover, the thorns of the vines themselves were purported during the [[Red Death period]] to transmit the [[Red Death]] themselves and perhaps even to serve as sensory organs connected to the soldiers of the Red Court.

## The Red Death

The [[Hexecraft pacts]] forced upon the victims of the Red Court spread like a particularly aggressive biological infection, with the exact symptoms and spread varying greatly between species. Despite their natural resistance to its symptoms, the [[Nycter]] colony that called the [[Nyxblight Tree]] home has been brought nearly to extinction by the by the [[Red Death]]. Upon their contact with the [[Quest|questing party]] of [[House Lightbringer]], this plague was transmitted to humanity for the first time and ultimately brought back to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] by the ships of the [[Shipwrights Guild]]. This ushered in the [[Red Death period]].

At the point of infection, the hex begins to take over the host's [[aura]], siphoning off their [[albedo]] to the Red Court itself. As this divine energy is parasitically drained, it is used against them to warp their body from the inside out. The infected are commonly afflicted by this ever-present and compulsive hunger for albedo, an extreme sensitivity to light and flames, horrific physical transformations, and autotomic abilities up to and including the reanimation of one's lifeless corpse.

## The Red King

The [[Red King]] serves as the Red Court's sole champion. They suffer from a different kind of physical transformation: their skin petrified, knotted, and black like the dead wood of the [[Nyxblight Tree]] their master calls home.; their hair turned into yellowed leaves; the thorny, black [[Nyxblight]] vines wrapping their way around every inch of their body.

This curse also carries with it an unholy task: an eternity of serving the Red Court. In doing so, they serve as leader of the [[near-life]] legion of infected which they are [[psionically]] connected to via the extra-physical [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Sphere]] that the Red Court rules. They also protect the bloody, bioluminescent mass that is the [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]]'s form within the [[Prime Material Sphere]].

For the Red King that in [[Ages of the Known World|ages]] past was known as [[Fall of House Lightbringer|Lord Lightbringer]], this meant much more than keeping watch from the safety of the relative Nyxblight Tree. When the human [[quest|questing parties]] came looking for the source of the [[Red Death]] that had plagued and besieged [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and whatever connection it had to [[House Lightbringer]]'s [[Quest into Oblivion]], the Red King was forced to flee. Since then, he has [[Journey of the Red King|journeyed]] across the [[Known World]] pulling his master behind him within a thicket of nyxblight vines.
