The Golden Hart is a [[Minor Aspects|Minor Aspect]] and warden of the forests and glades of the [[Known World]]. First encountered by humanity along the [[Elven March]], they are best remembered today in connection to the [[Agisters Guild]] who held a [[Mutualist pacts|mutualist pact]] their their children.

## Docetic form

The truest form of the Golden Hart – as a child of the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind motes]] – is the movement of the air through the underbrush and trunks and canopies of the trees. Through this movement, they hear and smell all that goes on within their domain.

But to humanity they are recognized by a more physical form: that of a majestic creature that appears as if made of pure gold and stands as tall as the tallest of the forest's trees. Atop their head are a crown of bone that reaches upwards towards the [[Nyx]] and with which they communicate with the wind motes.

## Children of the Golden Hart

The forest-dwelling children of the Golden Hart – the majestic deer – safeguard their [[Iconic pacts|patron]]'s domain as wardens of the forests and glades of the [[Known World]]. Greatly attuned to this environment and to the secret voices of the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind motes]] themselves, they possess an [[extramundane]] ability to sense predators and other sources of danger, as well as to smell sickness and growth in the trees around them. Those blessed by their patron grow antlers of living wood and leaves which further strengthens this connection.

Humanity's [[Agisters Guild]] and their [[Agisters Guild#stag knights|stag knights]] came to form [[mutualist pacts]] with these children of the Golden Hart and in doing so became as their children themselves. Their [[Pact magics|pact]] granted them a portion of their companions' extramundane abilities and allowed them to become the most proficient foresters and rangers of the [[human clans]] and [[House|Houses]] in the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]].
