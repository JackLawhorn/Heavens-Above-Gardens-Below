Mutualist [[pacts]] are formed between two living beings of relatively equal [[Albedo]] rather than between an [[iconic pacts|iconic mage]] and a patron [[Aspect]]. As such, both parties benefit greatly from this relationship. Mutualist pacts are most commonly formed between the races of the [[Orior]] and a race of the [[noble beasts]].

## Prominent examples
