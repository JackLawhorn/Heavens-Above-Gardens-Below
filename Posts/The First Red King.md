Four months after departing from the [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|newly-founded]] [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]], the [[Sun Elves]] have rounded the shore of the [[Great Sea]] and now follow the [[Black Coast]] along their [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March|Post-Heliotropic March]]. There is a great and beautiful tree there, whose [[extramundane]] growth within the [[nyxfire]] storms of the [[Wild Magics]] has led it to become a massive landmark and natural wonder of the [[Known World]].

Among their ranks is Lux, a [[Griot]] of the [[Griot#Orders|Second Order]]. One night, they consult the wisdom of the [[Nyx]] and find themselves called to rise up a people – a potential race of the [[Orior]] – who call the great tree their home. Speaking to her comrades about this calling, it is agreed that the March has been slowed enough already by their former companions the humans. Determined still to complete this divinely ordained quest, Lux resolves to breaks off from their people and plans to reunite with them after spreading the [[Elven Tongue]] and their divine and secret knowledge to this founding race.

---

It takes Lux only a day to journey from the shore of the Black Coast where the [[Elven Legion|Legion]] had made camp to the understory below the great tree. Arriving as dusk falls, they look up and are in awe to find that what appears to be a massive cloud is descending from the canopy. Looking closer, they are shocked to see that this cloud is in fact comprised of what must be millions of creatures. They are possessed of large wings that allow sustained flight, unique among the races of the Orior for even the [[Storm Elves]] make use of their [[cloudcraft]].

A beautiful [[Nycter#Communication|song]] is carried down on the wind as the cloud changes course to meet Lux on the ground below. At first, the scene is chaos. Quickly, however, their attempts to communicate evolve from high-pitch screeches to the universal tongue of the Elves. As with the humans and every race on ever world before them, this came as a shock to the people who called themselves the [[Nycter]], but they quickly adapted and wished to know all the wisdom that this noble stranger had to offer on this world and the wider Nyx.

Lux found the Nycter beautiful and fascinating. Covered in fur and speaking from elongated snouts, they most closely resembled the wolves and foxes of this world. They possessed only poor and underdeveloped eyesight, but their powerful ears enabled them to "see" the world around them through the sounds and echoes of their songs. Furthermore, they held a close and protective relationship with the natural world around them: their cloud of millions called the canopy above their home, leaving their roosts every night to pollinate the plants here and promote verdant growth.

When conversation turned to their acts of worship, however, Lux began to grow concerned. According to the Nycter, all who lived here were under the patronage of an [[Aspect]] of the Night, Nox, who lived nearby in the roots of the great tree. By all accounts, this Nox had been a kind and fair patron who tended to the needs of this place and those who called it home. Hearing this, Lux knew the truth: Nox was a pretender, likely born of the Wild Magics, as the Night is the domain of the Nyx and the Nyx alone.

In the morning, they set out towards the trunk of the great tree and, once there, ventured into the tunnels of its root system ready to confront this pretender. Deep within this place, in the dark tunnels far from the light of day, they finally came upon a great chamber where were surprised to see not an Aspect of [[Ylem]] at all but a curious creature who appeared almost as a reflection of Lux themself. The creature, who appeared to be similarly surprised, introduced himself.

"Hail stranger and well met," he said. "I am Nox. I must confess that I have never seen one of your kind. What brings you to this place?"

"I am Lux," they responded without quite matching his pleasantries, "Griot of the Second Order and Sun Elf of the Legion. I happened upon this place by chance, and had hoped to meet the Aspect who calls themselves by your name. But I can see you are no Aspect of Ylem, what manner of thing are you?"

"Ah, an Elf of the Legion. So it is your tongue with which they spoke. I never claimed to be an Aspect, perhaps you have no better word for what I am. But I *have* sought to be as a patron to this place and its people. I am an inheritor of the [[Old World]], the last of my people if I had to guess. You may not have a word for us, but in our day we called ourselves *[[Verdigris]]*."

This elicited a dramatic response from Lux, who pulled their spear and summoned their nyxfire flames. "*Verdigris*? Surely you mean *Dark Elf*, child of the [[Dragon]]."

Lunging into battle without another word, the Sun Elf summoned every bit of their strength and made each strike with the intent to kill this natural enemy of their people. Though this Nox was unarmed, he was not felled by the first blow nor the second, and in fact returned their extramundane combat prowess in kind.

"I have known no Dragon, nor have I heard this name that you call me with such spite," he responded calmly while dodging fatal blow after fatal blow. "What, may I ask, have I done to warrant such lively assault?"

"Whatever evil you are doubtlessly perpetrating here is more than enough to warrant wetting my arm with your black blood," Lux replied.

"You must draw my blood then," their strange enemy sang, "and see that it is not black but green." After a pause he continued: "Are you not a Griot of the Second Order? Was it not the guidance of the Nyx itself who brought you here to me? Did the stars warn of an enemy or could they not have sent you to a new ally?"

This gave Lux pause for it was true: the message divined from the Nyx had not been one of warning. Could they have been blind to the presence of this adversary? Or worse, could their guidance have been wrong? "No," they thought, "my faith will not falter before the trickery of this pretender."

"What you say is true, *beast*," they spat with vitriol. "But how can I trust you?"

"I can offer no evidence besides my word," said Nox, noticeably surprised by his opponents change of heart. "You are welcome to stay here if you wish, and see for yourself that my intentions are just. Or must you away, back to the Legion?"

The Legion. Lux had almost forgotten about the Legion, now doubtlessly several days ahead if they killed this trickster and left immediately. But Nox's words rang in their head with a great a terrible truth: the stars themselves had guided Lux here and not simply to kill this enemy, of that they were certain.

"I am here for a reason, whether to slay you or...," Lux faltered as they put down their spear at last. "I am here for a reason."

"I appreciate the faith you must have to spare me, Lux the Sun Elf," Nox said as he caught his breath. "I suppose you can always kill me later, your combat prowess is worthy of the legends."

"I can and will," they replied, "should you fail to convince me."

And so Lux, a Sun Elf of the Legion and Griot of the Second Order, abandoned the March and their divine quest. They watched Nox intently for days and weeks, observing his nature of which they were less than trusting. How could they accept this façade, this act from their natural enemy?

But – incredibly enough – his words and actions stood up to scrutiny. The Nycter cloud regarded him as a patron and it was clear to see why. He truly cared for this place and its peoples, promoting verdancy and growth of the great tree and everything that rose up out of the soil beneath it. Truly, it was a beautiful place and – unlike many of the lands seeped in this [[fallen world]]'s Wild Magics – there was an order to it.

At first, Lux watched on with one hand gripping their spear. While Nox tended to this place, while he slept, while he bathed. But slowly their grip loosened until one day they found themselves working along side him.

Nox taught them the ways of the Verdigris, what little he remembered from ages past, and Lux found them to contain certain comforts and kindnesses that their past life in the Legion had never known. That they had never even known to be missing. Tenets of family and kindness and even romantic love.

Weeks turned to months and months to years, and somewhere in this time the two became companions and ultimately lovers. They guarded and ruled over this place and its peoples and lived together within the roots of the great tree. They became as legendary figures to the Nycter who, despite Lux's best efforts, insisted on worshipping them as Aspects of the Day and Night itself.

They lived there in peace for quite some time.

*What is this? Have I come to a world at last?* It had been eons since the [[Red Court]] had much reason to think anything at all. Floating through the inky black void of the Nyx, separated from their brothers and sisters the [[Umbral Aspects]] of the Dragon, they were more content to entertain themselves within a [[Red Court#Sphere of the Red Court|Sphere]] of their own creation. But now, they found themselves in orbit around a new world.

*It's small,* they thought, arguing amongst themselves, *and a beacon of nyxfire has already been lit here! Surely this is no fallen world, can be no home to us.*

*On the contrary,* they thought in another voice, *I sense that it already is home to one of our kind. Cousin [[Low Ones|Madness]], maybe more. What are the odds of a sign such as this?*

*A sign from the Dragon himself,* thought yet another voice. *Surely such a thing is unheard of. I suppose this world may be a match for our appetite after all.*

Over days their orbit brought them closer and closer to the Known World. But when they came crashing down to the surface, their trajectory seemed to bring them towards a great body of water that covered most of this pitiful new home of theirs. The thought sent them reeling, a visceral reaction that thankfully altered their course and had them crashing instead into a great tree some ways into the coastline.

---

Lux was out gathering a meal for them and Nox to share when they saw a small object fall from the sky and land by their great tree. Surely it was a sign from the Nyx itself? The thought clenched Lux's heart with an icy grip, for they had abandoned their divine quest after all to live this life of comfort. Leaving what they had foraged behind, they ran to find Nox so that together they might search for the site of the foreign object.

But when Lux returned to the roots of the great tree they felt a dark presence there. As they slowly progressed through the tunnels and further into the interior, the shadows grew darker and darker – but also deeper and more substantial.

"The Dragon," they thought, "here?"

Their hand instinctively moved towards where their spear would have hung, but of course Lux had not wielded it in months. "Where is it?" they thought, "The chamber?"

When Lux arrived to the chamber where their spear lay and where they had last seen Nox, they found it drenched in a deep, blood red, a kind of false light. And standing in the corner with his back to them was the Dark Elf of the Verdigris that was once Nox.

Already, the dark influence of the Red Court had transformed him. Certainly he more closely resembled the Dark Elves of legend: more bestial with a larger, hulking frame. Around the chamber lay the tattered, butchered corpses of four, maybe five Nycter.

"Lux," he said, still facing away, "returned so soon? I fear I've eaten already."

No time to think. Lux's bronze spear lay covered in dust to their right, about equal distance from them and from Nox. No. Not Nox, the beast. The Dark Elf. Enemy of the Legion and of Ylem. My enemy.

The two started sprinting simultaneously, the beast not one step behind Lux. They both dove, one for the spear and the other for its prey. The next thing they knew, Lux lay against the chamber wall, spear in hand. Above them was Nox, speared through the abdomen, sticky green blood falling in buckets from what was obviously a fatal wound.

"Lux...," he just barely managed to utter under the strain of death and whatever dark influence had gripped him. The last thing Nox said before slumping over in death was, "The Nyx is falling."

---

Faced with the loss of both their own people and now their lover, Lux was quickly consumed by the Red Court. When they next stepped out of the roots of the great tree, they were no longer Lux, Sun Elf of the Legion and Griot of the Second Order. No, instead they were the second Red King.

They were transformed, physically and mentally. Their Elven beauty was lost, hidden under a thick layer of yellowed leaves and black bark. No longer was the voice in their head that of their conscious but of the many voices of the Red Court. And, blessedly, no longer did they grieve all that they had lost.

From the [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Sphere]] of their dark master, they gained new perspective. The Umbral Aspects were descending upon the Known World. Already, two were here at least and that meant the rest could not be far behind. Was this what the beast who had been Nox had meant?

Quickly, the great tree they had called home was dead and overgrown with the thorny, black [[nyxblight]] vines. This [[Nyxblight Tree]] was a stain upon the Known World, but one that continued to lure in races of the [[noble beasts]] and of the Orior to feed on them. Those who had already been here fell into a steep decline, influenced by the Red Court and afflicted with its hex plague: the [[Red Death]]. The Nycter cloud begged the Red King first for help and then for mercy, but none was forthcoming.

When death came for them as it did for all Elves of the Legion – quickly and with certainty according to the divine blueprint of the [[Angels]] who had created them – it was a blessing. The Second Red King sat slumped over in the chamber they had shared with Nox when they were known as Lux, in the spot where they had killed their companion and lover. On their left, the corpse of the beast. On their right, the red, bioluminescent mass that was the true form of the Red Court. They could only hope that their [[albedo]] would leave this accursed world, drifting far away across the infinities of the Nyx.

Years later, perhaps decades, the man who was [[Fall of House Lightbringer|Lord Lightbringer]] stumbled into the chamber, already lost just as Lux had been and hardly noticing the corpse of the Second Red King that lay there still.
