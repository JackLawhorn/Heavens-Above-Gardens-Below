A punctuation mark at the end of the [[Red Death period]] and one of the defining events of the [[Crisis of Hubris]], the great Burning unleashed by the [[House of the Sun]] and their [[House of the Sun#Daywatch|Daywatch]] razed the portion of the [[Old City]] now known as the [[Red Quarter]]. Flames of pure [[nyxfire]] cast down from the top of the [[Elven Signaltower]], defeating the threat of the [[Red Court]] and their [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] once and for all â€“ at least here in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

## Machinations of the Daywatch

After months of tending to the [[nyxfire]] flames non-stop throughout the [[Red Death period]]'s [[Long Daylight]], the [[House of the Sun#Daywatch|Daywatch]] had suffered from significant physical and psychological consequences of their post. In the weeks leading up to the great Burning, they had resorted to pleading with the [[nyxfire motes]] there within the [[Elven Signaltower]]'s flame for them to intervene and purge the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] of the [[Red Court]] which had besieged it. Passive and impartial as ever, they were able to elicit little response from these potential allies.

## The Night of the Burning

When the [[nyxfire motes]] in the [[Elven Signaltower]]'s flame finally accepted the pleas of the [[House of the Sun#Daywatch|Daywatch]], humanity within [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] had only an hour of notice before the [[Red Death period City of Gardens#Enemy territory|enemy territory]] in what is now the [[Red Quarter]] would be incinerated in a flash. With dozens of [[Apotropaics]] and night watchers in the line of fire, one last massive evacuation effort was launched to spread word and prevent as many casualties as possible. The [[Rookish clans]], who were able to flit about the rooftops across the [[Red Death period City of Gardens#The warding line|warding line]], were instrumental in warning their comrades.

The Burning began in the blink of an eye and was visible to lookers on as far away as the horizon. First a flash from the Signaltower and then a thin beam of pure [[nyxfire]] extending from its top downward towards the City below. The flames were all-encompassing and all-consuming, and they grew taller in height even than the City's towers and [[roccas]].

## Results and consequences

The flames of pure [[nyxfire]] cast down by the [[nyxfire motes]] of the [[Elven Signaltower]] burned for days and days. While it did end the [[Red Death period]] and the threat of the [[Red Court]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], it brought with it a number of great and terrible consequences for its populace.

### The razing of the Old City

Though deemed necessary, the razing of what is now the [[Red Quarter]] of the [[Old City]] was certainly a disastrous end to the [[Red Death period]]. The flames of pure [[nyxfire]] engulfed roughly 40% of the [[rota]], and an unknown number of [[Apotropaics]] who were not warned in time to evacuate [[Red Death period City of Gardens#Enemy territory|enemy territory]]. The still-flaming rubble would take years to inspect and clear, and these efforts along with the necessary rebuilding would necessitate the [[Reconstruction]] that stretched through the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and into the [[Renascence period]].

A greater loss still was the destruction of the vast majority of humanity's cultural and historical artifacts from before the Red Death period. The greatest controversy of this time, many blamed the [[House of the Sun]] despite their role in defeating the [[Red Court]]. As a result, the [[Great House]] would assume responsibility before [[Court]] and take on the role of humanity's [[House of the Sun#Lorekeepers|lorekeepers]] into perpetuity.

### Shades in the City

The pure [[nyxfire]] cast down from the [[Elven Signaltower]] and the flames that burned for days afterwards deepened the shadows cast by their light until the surrounding areas were overtaken by the [[extramundane ]]biome known as [[Shades]]. For weeks afterwards, great plumes of smoke covered the skies above [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], visible from much of the [[Known World]].

The City became populated by [[shade motes]] who are native to the Shades. Despite their [[Shade motes#Draconic heritage|Draconic heritage]], these minor [[Umbral Aspects]] were mostly benign. They walked the streets, looking on at humanity as they rebuilt in the wake of this disaster.

### Weakening of the Elven Signaltower's flame

Though the Burning succeeded in defeating the [[Red Court]], the [[nyxfire motes]] of the [[Elven Signaltower]] warned that their great power was not without limit. It is unknown how many times this ultimate power can be unleashed, or if it can ever be unleashed again. As the marker of not only [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] but of all the [[Known World]] and its place in the [[Nyx]], the faltering of the Signaltower's light could have disastrous effects on all who live in this world.
