The Agisters Guild is one of the oldest human [[Guild|Guilds]] and is remembered as one of the minor losses of the [[Early Renascence period]]. They are remembered for the stoic nobility of their [[#stag knights]], for their beautiful [[mutualist pacts|mutualist companions]], and for the many beautiful species and varietals of trees that they brought to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

## Mutualist pacts of the Agisters Guild

As far back as the [[Later Heliotropic Age]], the ancestors of the Agisters Guild forged a [[mutualist pacts|mutualist pact]] with a race of [[noble beasts]] that ruled over the many forests of the [[Old World continent]]: the majestic deer. Greatly attuned to the forest, the deer possess an [[extramundane]] ability to sense predators and other sources of danger, as well as to smell sickness and growth in the trees around them.

And just as the wind flows through the canopies of the trees, the deer's antlers allow them to hear the otherwise secret voices of the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind motes]]. The wind carries many secrets with it: scents and sounds and energy. Those blessed by their [[Iconic pacts|patron]] – the [[Golden Hart]], [[Aspect]] of the glades and forests – grow antlers of living wood and leaves which further strengthens this connection.

## Stag knights

The stag knights were the best of the Guild and – graced by the [[extramundane]] abilities afforded to them by their [[Mutualist pacts|mutualist pact]] – became some of the [[Known World]]'s most proficient foresters and rangers. Entirely in their element in the forests outside of the walls of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the stag knights protect the workers of the Agisters Guild as they venture out for the live-giving wood upon which they have staked their [[Guild]]'s [[House|Houseship]].

They sense danger and herd their ranks to safety. They listen to the wind and smell the rot in the trees and they find their way through places far from home. And when they walked the streets of the City or rode atop their mounts, they commanded more respect than most warrior classes of the [[Jurisweard]].

## Industry: Lumber and arboriculture

The [[extramundane]] abilities afforded to them by their [[Mutualist pacts|mutualist pact]] enabled the Agisters Guild not only to thrive in the forests of the [[Known World]] but also to become an influential [[House of Industry]] around the industries of lumber and arboriculture. They venture outside the walls of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and bring home trees, saplings, and raw wood to be used in the manufacturing of any number of good.

In the [[Reconstruction]] of the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], the access to species and varietals of trees they were able to provide led to advanced biodiversity in the [[gardens of the City]] and elsewhere throughout. Flowering trees and those that bore fruit were of particular interest, and today – centuries after their [[Fall of the Agisters Guild|fall]] – there are thousands of species from faraway lands that first arrived with the Guild's arboriculturists.
