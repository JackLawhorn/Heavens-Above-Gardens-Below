Though it is the nature of [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]] to constellate around domains of the natural world, the vast metropolitan environment of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] quickly became densely populated with a number of [[Minor Aspects]] of its own. Some wander the streets and the [[rayas]], others haunt houses and squares and places of worship. Others still – like [[Ēkhō, Minor Aspect of Sound]] – bounce from surface to surface and wall to wall.

Their nature is as varied as their appearances. They are an everyday sight, and to coexist with them is a natural part of life in the City. Of course, there are those who are [[#Worshipping the Minor Aspects|worshipped]] by the populace, but so too are there those – the weaker of their ranks – whose domains afford them simple, unobtrusive existences.

## Worshipping the Minor Aspects

Built on a foundation of [[Henotheist|Henotheistic]] worship, a majority of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s population worships one or more patron [[Aspect|Aspects]] in addition to adhering to the [[House of the Sun]]'s [[state religion]]. Worship may be performed in any number of locations and in any number of ways based on the domain of the [[Minor Aspects|Minor Aspect]] and their prevalence in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. For example, the Aspects of the river [[Torrente]] or of the [[Gardens of the City|gardens]] can be readily found there and tending to those domains is a popular form of worship.

The ultimate form of worship is to enter into an [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]]: a [[pact magics|formal contract]] between a person or people and a patron Aspect. Such rituals are overseen by the [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] and by the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] as a governing body.

## Urban Aspects

In addition to [[Ylem]] governing the [[Gardens of the City|gardens]] and the [[wol stone]] cliffs and the river [[Torrente]], there are a number of so-called "Urban Aspects" who civilization and the beating heart of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] itself has given way to. The [[monuments]] and [[walls]] of the City, its towers and [[roccas]], the bridges that cross the river, even the streets and [[rayas]] of the [[rota]]; all of the City of Gardens is alive with the divinity of Ylem.

### Origin of the Urban Aspects

To scholars of the [[Magics in the Known World|magics]], it is an area of particular interest to trace the taxonomical origins of the various [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]]. Based on complex taxonomical theory and the legends of various peoples of the [[Known World]], some have theorized that the Urban Aspects descended from the youngest of the [[Mundial Aspects#Motes of the landscapes|motes of the landscapes]].

Lore converges around the arrival of the first [[nyxfire motes]] to this world from across the [[Nyx]]. It is said in the stories of many peoples of the [[noble beasts]] and of the [[Orior]] that a nyxfire mote called *[[Estía of the Hearth|Estía]]* met with the first new people of the Known World – who rose up from the mud of the earth – and gifted them with a flame that they might gather around in the dark. Mixing with the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]], Estía birthed a single child: [[Domus, the Aspect of Home]]. Though this first people did not live to see the light of the [[Elven Signaltower]], every people and every creature since has known the comforts of home.
