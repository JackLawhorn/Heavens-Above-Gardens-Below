The Bloodhounds are an elite fighting force selected from the persecuted [[Clan Wolfstepper]] by the agents of the [[Jurisweard]]. Loyal to their masters above even their own people, they serve a vital role as a bridge between the Clan sequestered to the [[Argent Ghetto]] and the rest of humanity outside its walls.

## Soldiers of the Jurisweard

Only a handful of Bloodhounds are selected by the [[Jurisweard]] from every generation of [[Clan Wolfstepper]]. Several dozen begin this process, but only two or three move forward to join the Bloodhounds themselves. Candidates are primarily evaluated for their resolve and loyalty towards the mission of the Jurisweard. Their masters also carefully consider their connection to the rest of the Clan in the [[Argent Ghetto]]. The perfect candidates are able to command authority there but are not vulnerable to conflicting loyalties which can greatly affect the work they need to do there.

Once they have been formally selected, these candidates are trained in and further evaluated for their strength, fighting ability, and mastery over [[Iconic Pact of Clan Wolfstepper|their extramundane abilities]].

## Privileges of the Bloodhounds

The [[cland]] bloodlines in the [[Argent Ghetto]] offer their children as candidates for the [[Jurisweard]]'s Bloodhounds in a wishful gamble for a better future. If successful, they will be afforded significant freedoms and privileges not afforded to the much-persecuted [[Clan Wolfstepper]].

They are not only able to leave the walls of the ghetto but also to enter the halls of the [[Court]] and sometimes even to leave [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] entirely â€“ both impossible for the other children of Clan Wolfstepper, even with a working license. Bloodhounds hold the right to carry arms and are even afforded a small collection of [[silver]] arms, armor, and trinkets upon conscription.

## Reputation of the Bloodhounds

In addition to the material privileges afforded to the Bloodhounds, they receive significant social benefit as well. As [[Remnants of the Fallen Houses|remnants]] of a [[Fallen Houses|Fallen House]], [[Clan Wolfstepper]] faces persecution far greater than the other [[cland]] cultures in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. But those elevated to the station of the Bloodhounds receive a modicum of recognition as agents of the [[Jurisweard]] in their own right.
