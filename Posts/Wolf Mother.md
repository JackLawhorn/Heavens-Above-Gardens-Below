The Wolf Mother is a [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]] and [[Iconic pacts|patron]] to all predators of the land, including humanity's [[Clan Wolfstepper]]. Now, in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], she has been silent even to her children for an [[Ages of the Known World|age]].

As a [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]], the Wolf Mother's primary form within the [[Prime Material Sphere]] is the larger of the two moons that still sit in the [[Nyx]] above the [[Known World]]. The [[silver moon]] is the eye through which she looks upon all that happens beneath the night sky and is made entirely of [[silver]]. All deposits of this [[Docetic materials|docetic material]] in the Known World has come crashing down to the surface from her lunar form.

In her interactions with her children in [[Clan Wolfstepper]] and others under her [[Iconic pacts|patronage]], the Wolf Mother instead manifests as an old, blind dire wolf, its skin is so scarred as to be pockmarked like the cratered surface of the [[silver moon]] above.

## History of the Wolf Mother

When she entered into an [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]] with her human children – now known as [[Clan Wolfstepper]] – in the [[Elven March|Elven March period]], the Wolf Mother revealed that her influence was in decline. It was by the birth of the [[Silver Wolves]] who worshipped her as their [[Iconic pacts|patron]] that she was able to hold off this decline for an [[Ages of the Known World|age]] longer. The prominence of the Silver Wolves, who were among the great [[human clans]] and were named one of the original four [[Great House|Great Houses]], brought their patron an equal rise in influence throughout the remainder of the [[Heliotropic Age]] and throughout the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]].

In the [[Red Death period]], the Wolf Mother was sequestered within the [[extra-physical]] [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Sphere]] of the [[Red Court]]. During this period, she was silent to her children and all others across the [[Known World]] below, and her [[silver moon|lunar form]] was stained blood red in color. After the defeat of the Red Court, this [[Red Moon]] came to an end and it was revealed that for months she fought tooth and nail against the horrors of her captors.

This fight had weakened her influence within the [[Prime Material Sphere]] like nothing had before. She revealed to the Silver Wolves in secret that the [[Luminary#prohesy of the Luminary|prophesized]] birth of her child the [[Luminary]] would necessarily come prematurely, a warning that inspired the kidnapping of the child's mother and their departure from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] – what is now remembered as the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves]] – in the final days of the [[Crisis of Hubris]]. Forming the cult known as the [[New Silver Age]] out in the wilds of the Known World, her children awaited the birth of the Luminary and the future she would usher in. With her birth in the early months of the [[Renascence]], however, the Wolf Mother fell completely silent and has remained as such for an [[Ages of the Known World|age]] now.
