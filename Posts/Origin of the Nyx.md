[[Ylem]] was the very first thing to spring into existence, and as such it came as a violent explosion that rocked the all-encompassing nothingness that had been there before. All that was not – pained by the indescribable wound that had been inflicted upon it and impatient to strike back at this strange new threat – began to take take shape: what we now call the [[Dragon]].

Buffeted by the freezing cold and immense pressure of the void, the then still-singular Ylem was too forced to respond to this aggression. But its only weapon against the unreality of the Dragon was creation itself, and so it began to divide and duplicate and reproduce. Among its first creations were the [[Laws of Power]] Space and Time and other new dimensions of reality that would be as chains restricting the beast.

The reality created by the Laws of Power was comprised of heavenly [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Spheres]]. At its heart was the [[Astral Sphere]] which was formed out of what came before, the old and digital existence that Ylem and the Dragon had emerged from. As the Spheres rotated, they scraped against each other with a great friction and whittled each other down until they turned without issue. When they came to be their final shape, their intersections and overlaps described all that we call the [[Nyx]].

Constrained by the reality it itself had given birth to, the raw creation of Ylem would not be enough to beat back the threat for long and so it soon chose to tame its own [[Wild Magics|Wild]] nature. It forged powerful arcane armor around itself and, though it was greatly against its nature, thus equipped itself for the war effort. Such was the rise of the [[Angels]] of Heaven.

And the greatest weapon that the Angels wielded against the overwhelming force of the Dragon was life itself. They populated the Nyx with worlds and seeded those worlds with the potential to give way to life. Once seeded, the worlds would each produce a [[Elven Legion|Legion]] of warriors born and bred to fight as soldiers in this great [[roiling of the Nyx|roiling]].
