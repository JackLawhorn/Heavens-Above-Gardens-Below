> Though these materials are free to access under [[Public Scholarship]] law, the [[Office of the Orator]] reminds us that the storied [[Fall of House Lightbringer]] during the [[Crisis of Hubris]] teaches us to be weary of one's Hunger, and not to confuse it for the call of righteous destiny.

## Extramundane properties and abilities

House Lightbringer and their [[House Lightbringer#Paladins of Ylem|paladins]] are humanity's born warriors, physically and genetically altered from generations spent closest to the [[Sun Elves]] along the [[Elven March]]. Some standing three strides tall, their [[extramundane]] stature and musculature bears an almost striking resemblance to the Elves. Their skin, though not stone-hard like that of the Sun Elves has been known to resist cuts and slices from enemy blades.

From their Elven companions, they also learned of the arcane [[organic magics]] that flowed through their blood and was passed from generation to generation. Though they lacked organic magics of their own – for they lacked that spark that only [[Ylem]] itself could grant – they did form a bond with the [[nyxfire motes]] over the course of these learnings. Where the Sun Elves could command them to summon flames, Clan Lightbringer could summon but a single spark. Still, this feat made them as demigods among the [[human clans]].

## Role in the City

With their [[#extramundane properties and abilities]] gained along the [[Elven March]], Clan Lightbringer was thrust into a position of responsibility for the other [[human clans]] just as the [[Sun Elves]] had been. The perception of [[Heliotropic Age|Heliotropic]] humanity, as well as their own sense of divine, righteous responsibility, led them to become a great and reliable asset to their people both during the March and in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

### Humanity's leaders

Along the [[Elven March]], it was Clan Lightbringer who heard the rumors of the [[Sun Elves]] of their departure from the [[human clans]] and who brought together the great clans who would lead the early settling of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. After the founding of the [[Court]], they were among the first to gain not only [[House|Houseship]] but also to be [[Naming of the Great Houses|named]] as a [[Great House]].

They protected the City, manning its many walls and patrolling the streets, [[rayas]], and rooftops of the [[rota]]. Their [[Orator|Orators]] naturally fell into the role of leading the Court, with those of the [[Silver Wolves]], [[Oremongers Guild]], and the [[Materialists College]] often preoccupied with their own industries, interests, and [[Quest|quests]].

### Keepers of the Signaltower

After the construction of the [[Elven Signaltower]] was completed and the [[Elven Legion|Legion]] departed [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and continued their [[Elven March|March]], keeping and maintenance of the burning light of [[Ylem]] was left to House Lightbringer who held a connection with the [[nyxfire motes]]. The keepers kept constant vigilance over the tower, operating the mechanisms which filtered and directed its light just as the [[Sun Elves]] had instructed.

Even after their [[House Lightbringer's Questing Charter|departure]] from the City to pursue their [[Questing Charter]] east and which led to their [[Fall of House Lightbringer|fall]], it was their descendants in the [[House of the Sun]] who continued this righteous work.

### Paladins of Ylem

Closest to the [[Sun Elves]] and later the [[nyxfire motes]], House Lightbringer gained great reverence for the light of [[Ylem]]. As the rest of humanity came to worship the many [[Aspect|Aspects]] of Ylem and form their own [[Iconic House|heterodoxies]], House Lightbringer continued to serve the [[Angels]] and enforce their vision of the order these divine architects had designed.

From House Lightbringer came humanity's first paladins, a warrior class who wandered the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] and took it upon themselves to enforce law and justice. These paladins were the forebearers of the [[Jurisweard]], and after their [[Fall of House Lightbringer|fall]] a great many of the [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] would come to produce their own paladins.
