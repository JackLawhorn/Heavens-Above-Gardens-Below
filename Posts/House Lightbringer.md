House Lightbringer was one of the original great [[human clans]] along the [[Elven March]] and the first to be named a [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the [[Court]]. Until their [[Fallen Houses|fall]] in the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]], they were among the greatest leaders of humanity in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

## The lineage Torchbearer

From within House Lightbringer and the Clan Lightbringer that preceded it arose the noble and heroic lineage called Torchbearer. These warrior mages came to be seen as the prototypical paladins of their [[House]]: to a one possessing an [[extramundane]] stature and a certain closeness to the [[Nyxfire motes]] which lent them an undeniable similarity to their mentors the [[Sun Elves]]. Until the [[Fall of House Lightbringer]] in the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]], each [[Lord Representative]] of the [[Great House]] named a Captain from this lineage to stand beside them as their second.

The third Captain Torchbearer – who served as second to the third Lord Lightbringer and departed from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] alongside him on their [[Quest into Oblivion]] – is remembered as a beacon of light and a hero of legend today. Her name and visage graces the many walls and monuments of the City.

## Extramundane properties and abilities

House Lightbringer and their [[House Lightbringer#Paladins of Ylem|paladins]] are humanity's born warriors, physically and genetically altered from generations spent closest to the [[Sun Elves]] along the [[Elven March]]. Some standing three strides tall, their [[extramundane]] stature and musculature bears an almost striking resemblance to the Elves. Their skin, though not stone-hard like that of the Sun Elves has been known to resist cuts and slices from enemy blades.

From their Elven companions, they also learned of the arcane [[organic magics]] that flowed through their blood and was passed from generation to generation. Though they lacked organic magics of their own – for they lacked that spark that only [[Ylem]] itself could grant – they did form a bond with the [[Nyxfire motes]] over the course of these learnings. Where the Sun Elves could command them to summon flames, Clan Lightbringer could summon but a single spark. Still, this feat made them as demigods among the [[human clans]].

## Role in the City

With their [[#extramundane properties and abilities]] gained along the [[Elven March]], Clan Lightbringer was thrust into a position of responsibility for the other [[human clans]] just as the [[Sun Elves]] had been. The perception of [[Heliotropic Age|Heliotropic]] humanity, as well as their own sense of divine, righteous responsibility, led them to become a great and reliable asset to their people both during the March and in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

### Humanity's leaders

Along the [[Elven March]], it was Clan Lightbringer who heard the rumors of the [[Sun Elves]] of their departure from the [[human clans]] and who brought together the great clans who would lead the early settling of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. After the founding of the [[Court]], they were among the first to gain not only [[House|Houseship]] but also to be [[Naming of the Great Houses|named]] as a [[Great House]].

They protected the City, manning its many walls and patrolling the streets, [[rayas]], and rooftops of the [[rota]]. Their [[Orator|Orators]] naturally fell into the role of leading the Court, with those of the [[Silver Wolves]], [[Oremongers Guild]], and the [[Materialists College]] often preoccupied with their own industries, interests, and [[Quest|quests]].

### Keepers of the Signaltower

After the construction of the [[Elven Signaltower]] was completed and the [[Elven Legion|Legion]] departed [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and continued their [[Elven March|March]], keeping and maintenance of the burning light of [[Ylem]] was left to House Lightbringer who held a connection with the [[Nyxfire motes]]. The keepers kept constant vigilance over the tower, operating the mechanisms which filtered and directed its light just as the [[Sun Elves]] had instructed.

Even after their [[House Lightbringer's Questing Charter|departure]] from the City to pursue their [[Questing Charter]] east and which led to their [[Fall of House Lightbringer|fall]], it was their descendants in the [[House of the Sun]] who continued this righteous work.

### Paladins of Ylem

Closest to the [[Sun Elves]] and later the [[Nyxfire motes]], House Lightbringer gained great reverence for the light of [[Ylem]]. As the rest of humanity came to worship the many [[Aspect|Aspects]] of Ylem and form their own [[Iconic House|heterodoxies]], House Lightbringer continued to serve the [[Angels]] and enforce their vision of the order these divine architects had designed.

From House Lightbringer came humanity's first paladins, a warrior class who wandered the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] and took it upon themselves to enforce law and justice. These paladins were the forebearers of the [[Jurisweard]], and after their [[Fall of House Lightbringer|fall]] a great many of the [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] would come to produce their own paladins.
