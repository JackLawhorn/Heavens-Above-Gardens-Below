All beings who call [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] home fall into an informal social hierarchy that start with the [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]] themselves, then include the races of the [[Orior]] and the [[noble beasts]], and even the flora and fauna.

## Human social classes in the City

Within humanity's place within that fairly rigid hierarchy, there is a secondary hierarchy of more permeable social classes. Within these classes, one's influence and the respect they command is closely tied to the prominence of one's patron [[House]].

### Agents of the Court

The highest of the human social classes are the agents of the [[Court]], who hold immense sway over nearly every [[Social Spheres Theory|Social Sphere]] of life in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]: the [[Orator|Orators]] of the [[Great House|Great Houses]] then the [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] of the [[House|Houses]] and their cabinets.

Within that system, a House's prominence and influence certainly informs the prominence and influence of their representatives. The powerful [[Union|Unions]] – especially the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] and the [[Jurisweard]] – are high up on the social ladder. In the [[Later Renascence period]] and now in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], the Lords of [[Questing Houses]] of the [[Republic]] are treated as visiting foreign dignitaries and second only to the Orator herself.

Those described by this social class can be found in the halls of the Court and elsewhere in the City's [[White Quarter]].

### Leaders of the institutions

There exist a number of key institutions in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] – generally aligning with the [[Union|Unions]] – whose members and leaders enjoy elevated social status. Though not quite on the level of the agents of the [[Court]], they are nonetheless considered leaders of humanity and command more respect than the rest of the citizenry.

The [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] are the leaders of worship for the vast majority of humanity, and a strong pillar of the community. Their monks, clerics, and paladins are given due reverence for their closeness to their [[Iconic pacts|patron]] [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]] in accordance with the prominence of their domains. These leaders can be found in their respective places of worship or in the offices of the Canon.

The agents of the [[Jurisweard]] – made up of a great many warrior classes from disparate [[House|Houses]] – are tasked with upholding law and order. Their members are tasked with cases from the Court itself and afforded special powers to enforce justice as wandering peacekeepers. These leaders can be found in the halls of their patron Houses or in the offices of the Jurisweard.

The scholars of the City's various [[colleges]] – such as the [[Psionics College]], the [[Cult of Pythos]], the [[Mouseion]], and the [[Philosophers Guild]] – have long been considered among the best of humanity. In fact, [[Scholars of the City#Subjectivists|subjectivist scholars]] consider their scholarship to be the key differentiating characteristic of humanity among the other races of the [[Orior]]. These scholars can overwhelmingly be found in the [[Scholars Quarter]], from which they deal with all manner of intellectual pursuits.

### The rest of the citizenry

### Cland peoples

As of the [[fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of the [[Silver Wolves]] and the beginning of the [[Renascence]], those human peoples who still embrace their [[cland]] cultures – rather than the culture of [[House|Houseship]] that has been the de facto power structure since the end of the [[Red Death period]] – have faced persecution from the rest of humanity. The most prominent example is [[Clan Wolfstepper]] who are now sequestered within the walls of the [[Argent Ghetto]].

### Remnants of the Fallen Houses

> For more, see [[Remnants of the Fallen Houses]].

The [[Remnants of the Fallen Houses|remnants]] of humanity's [[Fallen Houses]] – those who have not been exiled – sit at the bottom of the social hierarchy in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Tied in the minds of their neighbors to the losses of the [[Crisis of Hubris]], these peoples carry the burdens of their ancestors from centuries hence.

The most respected are the [[Undergardeners]], remnants of the [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fallen]] [[Oremongers Guild]] who now tend to the [[Gardens of the City|gardens]] from which the City derives its name. Below them are [[Clan Wolfstepper]] continue to suffer the consequences of the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of the [[Silver Wolves]]. Only the [[Bloodhounds]] have risen to a slightly higher station thanks to their duties as agents of the [[Jurisweard]].

## The exiled

> For more, see [[Exile from the City]].

Not necessarily at the bottom of the hierarchy of the social classes but existing outside of and beneath it are those [[Exile from the City|exiled]] from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. The exiled most notably include the [[Dreaming psions]], the [[New Silver Age]], and the [[necromancer demons]]. The [[Jurisweard]] is always watching for intruders from these factions – who are generally considered the most dangerous of humankind – and are quick to dispatch them when they are spotted.
