They fell in the early hours of the night. Dark storm clouds above [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] had been clashing for hours, the light of the [[Storm Elves#nyxfire bolts|nyxfire bolts]] illuminating the sky and telling humanity that the campaigns of the [[Storm Elves]] against the [[Giants]] and their [[Giants#Empire of Dyēus|Empire of Dyēus]] raged on still. Not an uncommon sight, the populace of the City slept in their beds that night, assured that the Elves and their fleets of [[cloudcraft]] would prevail and that no harm would come to them.

Then, a calamitous blast much closer and louder, waking the City from their slumber. A flash of pure, white light, then the horrible crashing sound, and finally the shockwaves which reverberated throughout the City. Alerted by their patrons, the elemental [[Mundial aspects#earth motes|earth motes]], the [[Iconic pacts|iconic mages]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] felt it first and were the first to arrive at the crash site. Representatives from the various warrior classes who patrolled the City and night arrived shortly after: [[Silver Wolves]] and [[House Lightbringer#Paladins of Ylem|Torchbearer paladins]] and [[Rookish clans|Rooks]] of all plumages.

Just east of the City's outermost wall they bore witness to a massive crater, and at its center what appeared to be a lone figure laying motionless. When the advance party managed to traverse the mangled terrain and reach the center, they saw a sight that no human had laid eyes on since the [[nyxfall of the Elven Legion]]: a [[Storm Elves|Storm Elf]] nearly cleaved in two by some massive blade that could only belong to the Giants. It was clear that they had passed on, their [[albedo]] rejoining the [[roiling of the Nyx]] somewhere across the cosmos, and so the warrior classes gave way to the burgeoning [[Scholars of the City|classes of human scholars]] who sought to learn all they could from this magnificent specimen.

The [[Materialists College]], recently named one of the four [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the [[Court]], had first access to the corpse and all that fell along with it. It had been generations since any human had seen even a [[Sun Elves|Sun Elf]], and so there was much to learn and record about this great race and their [[Storm Elves#Anatomy of the Storm Elves|anatomy]]. The corpse boasted a number of much curious features: powerful eyes that most resembled the [[Rookish clans#raptor eyes|raptor eyes]] of the [[Rookish clans|rooks]]; coarse, wiry hairs that covered much of the body; and most interestingly bones that were hollow and lightweight.

Of even more importance to the Materialist scholars were the strange and arcane artifacts that littered the crater. A crystalline material, which they referred to in their notes as [[Docetic materials#Fulgurite|fulgurite]] seemed to have bore itself into the very earth, branching out from the impact point like the roots of a tree. The full deposit would take days to excavate and haul back to the Materialists College for study. The same material appeared to have been shaped into a blade, found damaged but largely intact just out of reach of the Storm Elf's corpse. The blade hummed when touched, some energy emanating from within.

Next were [[Cult of Pythos#Pythos|Pythos]] and his [[Cult of Pythos|disciples]], the [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivist scholars]] whose studies in the domains of mathematics and physics and the [[Laws of Power]] were revolutionizing human thinking about the cosmology of the [[Nyx]] itself. While the cult buzzed around the scene like flies to the corpse, sketching and measuring every inch of the crater, old man Pythos himself grew curious about the findings of the Materialists. In particular, he found the hollow bones of the Storm Elf fascinating. It is said that he spent hours looking up at the clouds in the sky above and, speaking to no one in particular, theorized that such lightweight anatomy might enable them to board their cloudcraft without falling through the ephemeral material.

Similarly, days later it is said that he was sketching a nyxfire bolt seen from the window of his study when the thought struck him that the shape of the fulgurite was identical. Indeed, the Materialist scholars found evidence that the fulgurite was formed from a nyxfire bolt striking and superheating the earth. After his death that same year, his followers would find a note stashed away in the clutter of his study theorizing that the thunder of the nyxfire bolts was created by a penetration of a so-called sound barrier created by the Laws of Power and the [[Standard Elven Cosmology|intersection of the Spheres]]. This theory wouldn't be proven for several ages hence, but such was the way of Pythos, the first Objectivist.

The bards of the [[Mouseion]] were much inspired by these events and the findings of the other scholars. They penned and choreographed and performed great sagas about the campaigns of the Storm Elves in the skies above the [[Known World]]. They theorized about the history of the [[Giants]] and the [[Giants#Empire of Dyēus|Empire of Dyēus]], and they recontextualized the [[Giants#Foundational Giant myth|foundational Giant myths]] that they had been told by the [[Mundial Aspects]] along the [[Elven March]].

To the bard scholars, the Storm Elves represented hope for this world. The Sun Elves had departed from humanity on their [[post-Heliotropic Elven March]], perhaps never to be seen again. The [[Sea Elves]] had not been seen by any human since the nyxfall of the Legion, nor had any evidence of their presence in the depths of the [[Sink]]. In contrast, the Storm Elves were a frequent presence felt by humanity within the walls of Omphalos, the City of Gardens. Their storm cloud and powerful nyxfire bolts could be seen and heard and served as evidence that they remained to fight the good fight and protect this world from the lingering consequences of its [[fallen world|fall]].
