The Psionic Sphere is an [[extra-physical]] realm within [[Standard Elven Cosmology]] which manifests as the collective perceived reality of all sentient beings within the [[Prime Material Sphere]]. It was discovered by the first human [[Psion]] – now known only as the [[Pretender]] – in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and further explored throughout the [[Psionic Age]]. Such studies pioneered the field of [[psionics]] and launched the [[Psionics College]] to great prominence in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Court]].

## Psionic imprinting

Psionic imprinting describes the processes by which the [[Prime Material Sphere]] and the [[Psionic Sphere]] intersect with and influence each other. As an [[extra-physical]] [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Sphere]], the Psionic Sphere presents as a separate-but-overlapping reality. Though many extra-physical Spheres manifest phenomena from the Prime Material Sphere to some extent – most commonly appearing as an extension of the area surrounding the point of access – the Psionic Sphere is a complete perceived reality, manifesting all that is perceived by those on the peoples of the [[Orior]] and of the [[noble beasts]] and even by simple beasts. In this way, the Prime Material Sphere has significant influence over the Psionic Sphere.

Conversely, the latter also has influence in the former through the minds of the perceivers. Perceived reality can lend real [[Psionics|psionic]] power to objects, places, and even words in the Prime Material Sphere, power that manifests through its influence on the actions of the perceivers.

## Traversing the Psionic Sphere

As an [[extra-physical]] [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Sphere]], the Psionic Sphere can be traversed in more dimensions than our own [[Prime Material Sphere]]. [[Psion|Psions]] can assume new perspectives of the [[Known World]], jumping directly into those of the people around them – not only other humans but other peoples of the [[Orior]], the [[noble beasts]], and perhaps even simple beasts – and perceive through their own senses. This is typically done without taking action in the Prime Material Sphere, although psions of particular [[Psionics#psionic influence|psionic influence]] are able to coordinate their actions in both Spheres.

Behind and beyond perceived reality, there exist deeper realms within the Psionic Sphere that specially trained psions are able to access and manipulate. The [[Kingdom of Memory]] and [[Dwaal, the Dreaming State]] both hold their own secrets, magics, dangers, and native peoples.

### Kingdom of Memory

The [[Kingdom of Memory]] is a world within the Psionic Sphere that exists behind and beyond perceived reality. Thought to be a realm of Lord Time of the [[Laws of Power]], this place holds the jumbled, ever-shifting landscapes of perceived history: every memory, every moment painted by thick, overlapping layers of bias and rife with plunging cliffs down into the void of [[Kingdom of Memory#Forgetting|Forgetting]].

The Kingdom holds valuable information: secrets and truths known only subconsciously and otherwise lost to Time. But so too is it treacherous, especially in times of fear. Memory is constantly changing, warped by interpretation and reinterpretation, which creates dangerous terrain and potentially violent natives called [[Thoughtform#Haunts|Haunts]]. One charge of the [[Psion#Psiknights|Psiknights]] of the [[Pretender]] was to protect the populace of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] from such threats at the [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of the [[Psionic Age]].

### Dwaal, the Dreaming State

There exists a kingdom of dreams in the [[Psionic Sphere]], known as [[Dwaal, the Dreaming State]]. Those who are proficient in entering the Dwaal and traversing the dreams of those around them – a field of [[Mystic psionics]] pioneered by the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] during the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] – are known as *[[Mystic psionics#Dwaalstepper|dwaalsteppers]]*.

Both byproduct of and window into the greater mind, analysis of the Dwaal is commonly used to address psychological issues and combat the emergence of psychosis – traditionally the work of the Pretender's [[Mystic psionics#Psiknight|Psiknights]] and later the [[Agents of the Psionics College|agents]] of the [[Psionics College]].

## Objects and places of psionic power

Generally, objects and places of [[Psionics|psionic]] power influence the [[Prime Material Sphere]] through the actions of its peoples and beasts. These are easily identifiable by those psions able to traverse the [[Psionic Sphere]], but may range from indetectable to [[Psionics#Captivation|captivating]] for all others. Naturally-occurring objects of psionic power are far and few between, but are often [[docetic]] in nature – like the [[Docetic materials#Psicrystal|psicrystal]] which is coveted by the agents of the [[Psionics College]].

Most places of psionic power are sites within the Prime Material Sphere that intersect with the Psionic Sphere, where the two have more influence over each other – such as the [[Deep Deserts#mirages|mirages]] of the [[Deep Deserts]]. These can be created through [[#psionic imprinting]] as well, the apperception of the population leaving a mark within the Psionic Sphere. Many [[Umbral Aspects]] generate places of power which particularly significant influence, often spreading fear and dismay and darkness to those within the Prime Material Sphere.

### Psychedelia

[[Psionics]] is the extension of the mind to unlock and consciously control what would otherwise be subconscious processes. At the [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of the [[Psionic Age]], psychedelics – and most other methods of mind alteration – were commonly used in the [[Mystic psionics]] practiced by [[Disciples of the Pretender|the Pretender and their Disciples]]. After the disastrous revelation of the [[dreaming psions]] in the [[Early Renascence period]], such substances were outlawed by the [[Psionics College]] from all scholarly pursuits of the field of psionics and by the [[House of Vice]] from civilian use.

Nevertheless, the illicit use of psychedelics persists among scholars to this day, just as it does among the civilian population. 

### Psicrystal

Colloquially known as [[Docetic materials#Psicrystal|psicrystal]], this [[docetic materials|docetic material]] native to the [[Psionic Sphere]] is a hot commodity in the circles of humanity's [[Psion|psions]]. The material reacts to and in turn interacts with [[psionics#psionic influence|psionic influence]], glowing in the presence of powerful psions. It is said they can enhance the psionic influence of those around them, and the most wealthy of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s psions have spent several fortunes and lifetimes to retrieve and acquire obscene amounts of the psicrystal.

Fused together from the sand by magical artillery fire, [[Deep Deserts#Psicrystal columns|strange psicrystal formations]] now tower over the already massive dunes of the [[Deep Deserts]]. These formations resemble abstract sculptures of pinkish glass, sometimes as tall as mountains, and serve as home to nearly every [[Deep Deserts#Desert colonies|desert colony]]. Those of the deepest desert communities will live their entire lives in the shadow of the psicrystal formations and are said to possess extraordinary abilities that push the limits of what we understand psionics to be.

### Mirages of the Deep Deserts

In some of the oldest campaigns between the [[Elven Legion]] and the [[nyxfire]] storms of [[Wild Magics]] that covered the [[Known World]] in [[prehistory]], the wide open landscapes of the [[Deep Deserts]] far to the north were permanently and indescribably altered. Here, the membrane between the [[Prime Material Sphere]] and the [[Psionic Sphere]] is thin. This is thought to be the cause of the little-understood phenomena known as [[Deep Deserts#Mirage|mirages]], brought out of their mind and made real.

[[The Pretender and their Disciples]] marched into the Deep Deserts on their [[Quest into Oblivion]] looking for these portals. Ultimately, they were consumed by the mirages, left the Prime Material Sphere forever, and lost to the ravaging psionic forces of the Psionic Sphere.
