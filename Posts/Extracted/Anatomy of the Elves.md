# Anatomy of the Elves

---

## Sex, gender, and reproduction

Unlike the majority of the races of the Orior who developed across the [[Known World]] after its [[fallen world|fall]], the Sun Elves and the rest of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]] possess a hermaphroditic anatomy to simplify reproduction. All Elves possess male and female reproductive systems, which they use in pairs or in group settings to conceive.

Both fertility and libido are strictly regulated by bio-magical means, ensuring that their numbers remain relatively stagnant. In cases of extreme population decline, such as after a devastating battle, self-fertilization may even occur to enforce population growth.

## Growth and development

Pregnancy is short, between four and six weeks, and often painful as the Elven anatomy races to complete reproduction as fast as possible and allow the parent to return to battle. It falls to the weakest of the population, often wounded and recovering from a previous skirmish, to take care of newborns. This is short-lived however as they are typically self-sufficient after one year and will begin taking on minor responsibilities resembling those of Human squires. They are fully-grown after two years and will begin combat training and take part in their first battles.

As with conception and child-birth, the development of Elven children is consistent and streamlined. There are very few exceptions to the order and occurrence of the major developmental milestones, and those who lag behind the rest are generally considered unfit for battle and relegated to squire-like duties for life or until they prove their worth. Elves who lack typical instinctual skills usually display extraordinary aptitude in other skills from a young age. Children of evolution itself, Elves will hold outliers with favorable adaptations in particularly high regard.

### Developmental milestones

1) The first milestones are centered around developing a full range of physical movement, so that they may play a valuable role in Elven society as soon as possible. Newborns begin to walk at four months and will have full mastery of their body by eight months.
2) By twelve months, younglings possess a functional understanding of the Elven language. This stage occurs naturally and by instinct rather than needing to be taught. At this age, they are ready to begin serving as squires either to their parent or to another soldier in need of assistance. Squires perform duties like hunting, the tending of crops, and blacksmithing which are not instinctual but rather learned on the job.
3) At two years, Elves are fully grown and have reached adulthood. Nearly ready to join the front-lines of battle, they are taught high-level strategy and tactics to back up their instinctual understanding of hand-to-hand combat and the use of certain traditional weapons.
4) Not necessary for the Elves' eternal purpose, secondary language systems like sarcasm and body language are neither learned nor understood for decades. These skills may be learned through close friendships with comrades, but are more quickly learned through interaction with other races.
5) Reading and writing skills are considered extraneous, and Elves maintain their own oral history and storytelling traditions. Only the oldest among them are likely to learn to read and write, and primarily in the languages of other races out of necessity. Some have their own written version of the Elven language, but there is no single unified system.

### Lifespan

Elves have significantly longer lifespans than most other races, and will fall into old age after about two hundred years. At this point, the extreme efficiency of Elven anatomy turns on them, and health quickly declines in similar ways to elderly Humans. Once this process starts, it is uncommon for an Elf to live another five years.

Of course, Elves were never meant to make it to such an old age, instead designed as an able but ultimately disposable and replaceable military force. All but the most skilled warriors will die on the battlefield as opposed to death by old age, and those who do live to reach old age will often join the frontlines to die a warrior's death rather than submit to nature. Others will follow different paths, including raising newborns, serving as full-time hunters, or taking the role of Griot â€“ storyteller and keeper of the living oral history of the Elves.

## Physical dimensions and attributes

As a whole, the Elven race is more homogenous than others in terms of looks and most closely resembles Humans in terms of anatomy. As a non-gendered race, concepts like femininity and masculinity have no meaning and do not influence their build or other physical attributes. Elves are often portrayed by Humans as the basis of beauty standards both for men and for women.

- Adult Elves are imposing figures, standing between seven and eight feet tall and weighing between 250 and 325 pounds. Extreme musculature is common, though body types can vary between efficiently lean and monstrously bulky based on weapons and fighting styles of choice.
- Elven skin is pristine and falls in the median of the Human skin color range, a beautiful medium-brown. It is simultaneously soft to the touch and more durable than human skin, so much so that it is not uncommon for blade edges to glance off of it. Beneath the skin, Elves are noted as displaying perfect facial symmetry and bone structure.
- The primary differences beyond sheer size are their pointed ears and metallic-colored eyes, which range from copper to silver to gold and shine during both day and night. These attributes are the result of hyper-sensitive auditory and visual sense organs.
- Elven hair presents in as wide a range of colors as Human hair, and often is very different from the hair color of the parent. They share universal, non-gender-dependent hairstyles which tend to lean shorter as to stay out of the way in combat, and many keep it shaved or extremely short to minimize maintenance and effort. When it is allowed to grow long, Elven hair has an unnatural beauty and is prized for its application in string instruments.
