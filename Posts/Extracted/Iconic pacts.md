# Iconic pacts

---

Iconic [[pact magics|pacts]] are formed with powerful entities, called patron [[Aspect|Aspects]], which govern specific domains. Some Aspects are benevolent and some are cruel. Some Aspects require a formal pact, while others freely serve as a conduit to any who possess magical abilities of their own.
