Iconic [[Pact magics|pacts]] are formed with powerful entities, called patron [[Aspect|Aspects]], which govern specific domains. Some Aspects are benevolent and some are cruel. Some Aspects require a formal pact, while others freely serve as a conduit to any who possess magical abilities of their own.

## Prominent examples
- [[Clan Wolfstepper]] ([[Iconic pact of Clan Wolfstepper]])
- [[Oremongers Guild]] ([[Iconic pact of the Oremongers Guild]])
- [[Sobek]]
