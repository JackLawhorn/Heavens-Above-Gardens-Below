The Storm Elves are the air force of the [[Elven Legion]], wielders of powerful [[nyxfire]] bolts and pilots of a great fleet of [[cloudcraft]].

## Campaigns of the Storm Elves

Upon [[nyxfall of the Elven Legion]], the Storm Elves quickly split off from the [[Sun Elves]] and the [[human clans]], similar to the departure of the [[Sea Elves]] into the depths of the [[Sink]]. Climbing to the peak of the nearest mountain, they gathered raw material from the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind]] and [[Mundial Aspects#water motes|water]] motes. From these materials, they forged their fleet of [[cloudcraft]] one at a time and ascended into the skies above. There, above the chaos of the [[Wild Magics]] and their [[nyxfire]] storms, they witnessed the enormity of their enemy the [[Giants#Empire of Dyēus|Empire of Dyēus]]. So great were the citadels of the [[giants]] that the blue of the tiles which adorned them filled their view of the skies entirely.

From this point, human understanding of the campaigns of the Storm Elves become incredibly limited. Relics of the giants found in the [[Valley of Ruins]] suggest that they are a vicious, warlike people. Considering the sheer scale of their Empire, its conceivable that such campaigns might last several ages at the very least. Indeed, the [[benighted]] and oft-clashing storm clouds in the skies above the [[Known World]] point to the still ongoing status of the conflict.

## Organic magics of the Storm Elves

> The magics described here are specific to the Storm Elves, who are but one faction of their race. For a general overview of the magics that are shared by the [[Elven Legion]] as a whole share, see [[Organic magics of the Elven Legion]].

Like the [[Sun Elves]] and their flames, [[organic magics]] of the Storm Elves allow them to wield [[nyxfire]] bolts. These magics manifest in a number of different ways:

- A certain influence with and over the elemental [[nyxfire motes]]
- The summoning of powerful bolts to be wielded in combat
- The forging and piloting of aeronautical vehicles called [[cloudcraft]]

### Anatomy of the Storm Elves

Bioengineered by the [[Angels]] themselves for their respective roles in the eternal, cosmic conflict known only as the [[roiling of the Nyx]], each of the [[Elven Legion|Elven]] peoples bear noticeable differences from one another.

Favoring the long-range, heavy artillery of their [[nyxfire]] bolts, they are leaner and lack the imposing, [[extramundane]] physique which benefits the [[Sun Elves|Sun]] and [[Sea Elves]] in their close-quarters [[Combat Arts]]. Their cold, slate gray skin is significantly less resistant to slicing and stabbing, and curiously their bones are hollow like the many avian races of the [[Discoveries in the Known World#noble beasts|noble beasts]].

Their hair ranges from black and gray to silver and white, and it covers a much greater portion of their bodies. It is thought that this aids in their connections to the [[nyxfire motes]] and the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind motes]], allowing them to feel the movement of the wind and the crackling power of the nyxfire in the air around them.

Their eyes are range from stormy gray to metallic silver to a striking blue. To aid in their long-range combat, their sense of sight is significantly heightened, possibly similar in ability to the [[Rookish clans#raptor eyes|raptor eyes]] of the [[Rookish clans]].
