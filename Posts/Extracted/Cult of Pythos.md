## Pythos

Pythos, after whom the Cult is named, pioneered the concept of [[the Objective]] and is considered to have been the first true [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivist]].

Pythos came to prominence in the young [[Scholars Quarter]]. Disinterested by the work of his contemporaries, he began wandering the streets of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], observing the urban sprawl and taking precise measurements of everything he came across. His strange behavior drew attention and even crowds, until his completion of the first [[#Divine Geometries]] led to a significant following.

To Pythos, human historians and even the [[Sun Elves]] themselves were too focused on [[the Subjective]]. Even the scholars of the [[Materialists College]] – who studied biology and chemistry and the material sciences – he considered to have strayed from what he called the "Truth of Form" to pursue more abstracted fields.

By considering only the Objective of mathematics and physics without seeking to ascribe Subjective meaning to them, Pythos believed it possible for even lowly humanity to map the [[Laws of Power]] themselves.

## Divine Geometries

The Divine Geometries of the [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivist scholars]] have stood the test of time as some of the most foundational and resonant of all the [[Great Works]]. Conceived as mappings of the [[Laws of Power]] themselves, they portray what [[#Pythos]] called the "Truth of Form".

In the [[Later Renascence period]], the Divine Geometries would have great influence on the [[Office of the Orator]]'s attempts to recreate the [[Elven Legion|Elven]] art of [[astral divination]].

### The first series

From his detailed studies of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] – which involved taking precise measurements of every street, space, and structure – [[#Pythos]] envisioned the concept of a single spatial point without dimension. Imperceivable to humanity, he conceived of a representation of such a point as the first in a series of [[Great Works]]. Molding the clay himself in the halls of the [[Mouseion]], this first series of [[#Divine Geometries]] depicted first a point, then a series of points along a single dimension, then a series of line segments along a second dimension, and then a series of such planes forming a third dimension.

This series of pieces would not gain traction or acclaim with the other [[Scholars of the City]] or the wider populace with these first four alone. They were seen as simplistic, and were more or less understood as relatively unengaging mathematical models and little else.

Later codified into the canon of [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivism]], these first- through third-dimensional pieces would later become represented not only as points in space but as the perfect mathematical models they were able to represent. From these foundational works sprung definitions of polygons and polyhedrons, translated into Great Works themselves and put on display throughout the City.

After the [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild]], humanity was forced to relearn architecture in stone without the use of [[extramundane]] abilities such as those of the [[Oremongers Guild#Earth shapers|earth shapers]]. These early Divine Geometries would would be crucial concepts in the development of these technologies.

### The second series

Extrapolating from the third dimension, however, [[#Pythos]] conceived of two final pieces representing as of yet unexplored fourth and fifth dimensions. The third dimension, he reasoned, was contained within the domain of the [[Laws of Power|Law of Power]] the [[Sun Elves]] called Space. Within the [[Standard Elven Cosmology]], the space occupied by and perceivable to humans and the other races of the [[Orior]] was described by these three dimensions. But nothing in their perceived reality, he found, was actually described by only these three.

The fourth dimension was not the domain of Space but instead of Time, describing objects not locked in space but through which time itself flows to alter its positioning in the three basic dimensions. The fifth was the domain of thought, of intent, inherent only to life itself: not simply a predetermined series of events along the dimension of time but multiple possible series of events branching out from each moment and made real only by interaction and choice or perhaps random chaos.

These later [[#Divine Geometries|Geometries]] had significantly greater impact outside of Pythos's own fields. They offered a greater understanding of the cosmography of the [[Nyx]] within the already accepted [[Standard Elven Cosmology]]. They shaped human art and philosophy and the way they viewed the [[Known World]] itself.
