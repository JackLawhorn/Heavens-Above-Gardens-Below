# The history of the House of the Sun

---

The [[House of the Sun]] arose in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] from what remained of [[House Lightbringer]], and were put installed as a [[Great House]] of the [[Court]] in their place as they departed on [[House Lightbringer's Questing Charter|their quest]]. Though they wielded tremendous power in this station, they were a relatively inconsequential party in the politics of the Court until the [[Red Death period]], instead focusing on their role as the keepers of the [[Elven Signaltower]] and its [[nyxfire]] flame.

## The Red Death period and the Burning

During the [[Red Death period]], the [[House of the Sun]] rose to prominence due to their connection to the [[Elven Signaltower]] and the [[nyxfire motes]]. The [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] had few vulnerabilities, but had an aversion to the Signaltower's sunlight and were quickly incinerated when in contact with flames. From the ranks of the House of the Sun arose the [[Apotropaics#Torchbearer's Purifier clerics|Purifiers]] of Clan Torchbearer, who ventured into [[Red Death period City of Gardens#Enemy territory|enemy territory]] wielding torches and firebombs and flint-striker blades.

Based on evidence collected by the scholars of the [[Materialists College]], the [[Court]] put into motion what would come to be known as the [[Long Daylight]]. For months, the mechanisms of the Elven Signaltower were altered to maintain a consistent period of daytime in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and across the [[Known World]]. The keepers of the Signaltower's light during this time are known as the [[#Daywatch]]. Ultimately, the Daywatch were able to bargain with the nyxfire motes and put into motion the great [[Burning]] which razed what is now the [[Red Quarter]] and ended the Red Death period.

## Reconstruction

In the aftermath of the [[Red Death period]] and the great [[Burning]] which ended it, the [[House of the Sun]] came under a great amount of scrutiny as the engineers of the razing of what is now the [[Red Quarter]] and the destruction of the last of humanity's historical record. Standing before the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]] – those that remained in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] – the House of the Sun's [[Orator]] took responsibility and pledged that they would shoulder a great burden in penance: taking on the role of humanity's [[#lorekeepers]].

Since then, they have worked to recover what history they can, record contemporary human history, and ensure the survival of and access to those materials in the [[Public Record]]. Through [[Public Scholarship|Public Scholarship Law]], all goings on in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and humanity's efforts outside the City walls are recorded and archived by the [[Office of the Orator]] and [[#House of the Sun Aides]]. All matters of the Court are recorded and can be accessed in the [[Hall of Precedent]], which provides a foundation for its rulings and affords agency to the agents of the [[Jurisweard]].

Throughout this [[Reconstruction]] period, which extended past the end of the [[Crisis of Hubris]], the House of the Sun continued to rise in prominence. Three more [[Great House|Great Houses]] fell in the Later Crisis of Hubris: the [[Materialists College]], the [[Disciples of the Pretender]], and the [[Silver Wolves]]. With each fall, the House of the Sun and its Orator grew more powerful until finally they were the last remaining Great House. To this day, no new Great Houses have been named.

During this time, they also rose to prominence as the [[State religion]] in Omphalos, the City of Gardens. While the culture of [[Henotheist|henotheism]] remained, the horrors of the Red Death period lingered in the minds of the populace and they sought protection from the pure divinity of [[Ylem]] in addition to any [[iconic pacts|patron]] [[Aspect|Aspects]].

## The Renascence

Throughout the [[Renascence]], the [[House of the Sun]] has stood uncontested as the sole [[Great House]] of the [[Court]] and, in truth, its [[Orator]] has led humanity both within and outside of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] to heights never before seen. The Renascence was ultimately the great Golden Age that the [[Crisis of Hubris]] had been purported to be.
