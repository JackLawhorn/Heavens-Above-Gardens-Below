# The Messengers Guild

---

The Messengers Guild is one of the oldest [[cland]] [[House|Houses]] and are of [[Rookish clans#Rookish heritage|Rookish heritage]]. They have formed [[Mutualist pacts]] with the eyele pigeons, which deliver written messages all over the city.

## Industry: Communication

The first method of long distance communication developed by the humanity was the use of messenger birds. This practice lived on for millennia and was controlled by the Messengers Guild in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. The Guild was considered for [[Great House|Great Houseship]] alongside the first four [[Fallen Houses]] named in the [[Later Heliotropic Age]], but a super majority was not met in [[Court]] amid some concerns about their monopoly of the [[Social Spheres Theory#Sphere of Communication|Sphere of Communication]].

Their resilience meant constant adaptation to maintain their power in Court and in the City. Over the course of their [[House|Houseship]], the Guild also employed foot messengers, a number of psions capable of facilitating psionic telecommunication, and even a vast telegraph network. They would eventually fall from their Houseship at the turn of the Post-Enlightenment Era as radio provided a technological mode of communication which could be mass-produced at a relatively low cost. This technology was controlled by the engineer Houses, not the Messengers Guild, and effectively made them obsolete.

### Roccas

Many of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s towers and taller structures are controlled by the [[Rookish clans]]. Their height is coveted for the additional closeness to the [[Nyx]], but more importantly they are raised up to the level of their avian companions: the [[Discoveries in the Known World#Noble beasts|noble beasts]] of the sky. The top levels of many towers are, in fact, massive aviaries called [[roccas]] from which the birds flit back and forth. Smaller, self-contained roccas can be found on rooftops throughout the City, similar in design to modern water towers but much older.

These roccas were centers of industry for the Messengers Guild, and points of concentration for the communications of the entire City. The [[Rookish clans#Augurs|Rookish Augurs]] tended the roccas and dispatched messengers to relay newly received messages. This made the Augurs humanity's first real spymasters and intelligence officers, as they controlled the vast majority of information flowing through the City. 

### Telegraph network

In the [[Late Renascence Period]], the Messengers Guild were granted a [[Questing Charter]] to construct the largest communication network ever conceived in the [[Known World]]: a telegraph network connecting [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] via instantaneously transmitted electrical signals. It was to be the last [[Great Works|Great Work]] of the [[Renascence]] â€“ one last wonder putting a point on a golden age by the longest surviving [[House]] in the City.

Unfortunately, the project faced endless delays and would eventually be made almost obsolete by the invention of radio by a competing House. By the time the telegraph network project was indefinitely put on hold in the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]], only the [[City garrisons|City's garrisons]], the [[Scholars Quarter|Colleges]], the [[House of the Sun]], and the [[Court]] were connected.
