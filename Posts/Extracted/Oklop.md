# The Oklop

---

The Oklop are a race of heavily armored aquatic scavengers that form loose consortiums along the many coastlines of the [[Known World]]. Their [[Sun Coast]] consortium is home to a countless number of this gargantuan sea people, and they have formed a solid symbiotic relationship with humanity in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

## Anatomy

Extremely biodiverse as a result of generations lived in the twilight of the [[Sink]] where reality itself fades away, the Oklop vary greatly in anatomy. They have wide builds and flat heads sporting eyes as inky-black as the deep ocean, but otherwise may have some, all, or none of the following features:

- **Size.** Oklop range in height from roughly human-scale to larger than the [[Sun Elves]] themselves. They are significantly wider than they are tall, however, and their total size dwarfs any other race of the [[Orior]].
- **Speed.** Oklop are bulky and slow on land, but are proficient swimmers and climbers thanks to their many articulated, spear-like legs.
- **Armor.** While some Oklop are soft-shelled, the defining trait of most of the population is their hard exoskeleton that acts as a natural heavy armor. Each shell has a unique pattern of coloration which allows humans to tell one scavenger from another.
- **Claws.** Whether it's one large, armored appendage or a set of smaller, front-facing, vestigial ones, all Oklop possess at least one claw.
- **Smell.** Behind a pair of mandibles is a mouth used both for feeding and a powerful sense of smell through which the Oklop tell each other apart, communicate with each other, and which is the primary sense of the race.

## Communication

Communicating with each other using scent and smell, the Oklop do not possess the anatomical components to create speech as most other races of the [[Orior]] understand it. Instead, they are able to create a deep, mind-shaking vibrations. Over time, they have been able to alter these to convey simple words and phrases that a human might understand.

## Oklop hoards

Oklop are a mostly self-involved race, but have increasingly partaken in trade with humans who have much need for their ability to scavenge undersea caves, ruins, and wrecks. Not at all interested in monetary incentive, the Oklop work instead for a range of wildly different human trinkets and bobbles which they bury in secret to create vast, private hoards.

Because of this, they are known as avid traders and in fact founded the [[Great Sea Bazaar]] – a massive open-air market and the first in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. The Bazaar has grown to include the wares of other races of the [[Orior]], the [[Fisher Queens]]' fishmongers, and aquatic produce.

## Allies and predators

The biggest limit placed on Oklop population growth is neither aquatic nor terranean predation but the small overlap in coastal territory with both seawater and populations of the fish they feed on. They generally enter into symbiotic relationships with the nearby terranean populations, and can benefit greatly from port cities and the food they can clean off of the hulls of ships.

Frenzies of [[Akụm]] may be the biggest threat to most coastal races, but the Oklop are largely safe from their predation. In fact, their consortiums serve as a protective barrier for many coastal population hubs across the [[Known World]], protecting humans in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] from constant raids by these accursed hunters.

Instead, their primary predator is another breed of crustacea: the fearsome [[dragon shrimp]] that will occasionally invade a consortium and pick off surprised Oklop. The bludgeoning damage dealt by the dragon shrimp's devastating dorsal slaps are uniquely effective at dealing with the hard outer shells of their large prey.
