# Elven combat sports

---

The Elven Legion held a number of ritualistic events which would introduced the concept of sporting contest to humanity, who adopted these rituals themselves along the March of the Heliotropic Age. As with much of Elven culture, these traditionally revolved around combat. The combat sports can be categorized as either Hand-to-Hand or Armed.

The traditional one-on-one contest between two parties was performed within a ring marked on the ground, and was won by the competitor who forced their opponent out of the ring or to submit. Because of the Legion's nomadic lifestyle, these rings were traditionally drawn on the ground, dug in the dirt, or drawn in the sand. When in longer-term settlements, more permanent rings would be erected – often by the hosting culture. Most individual wrestling arts had their own variations on this format which disadvantaged party – or the challenged in the case of a duel – could choose.

## Hand-to-Hand

Hand-to-Hand combat sports were less lethal than their armed counterparts, but certainly not less dangerous or competitive. They served as trainings for the Elven younglings for whom the combat sports were rites of passage and even key milestones in development. For adults, Hand-to-Hand combat sports were key to communicating and maintaining the hierarchy of the Legion and the Elven society.

### Wrestling

Strikes were prohibited in all wrestling contest, and most wrestling arts instead focused on grappling. Many wrestling arts existed – each with their own strengths, weaknesses, honors, masteries, and rituals – and an Elf of the Legion would acquire proficiencies in several over the course of their life.

Wrestling is a game of strength, but also dexterity and strategy. The Legion's wrestling arts were, in fact, such impressive feats of cerebral contest that they would go on to inspire many human games of strategy including chess.

Because superhuman ability played less of a role in wrestling than in some other sports, human wrestling contests were generally unchanged from their Elven counterparts.

### Strike Boxing

Strike boxing is a more formal Hand-to-Hand combat sport than wrestling and a more common sport in dueling and ceremonial events. The traditional strike boxing contest would be performed by two parties, each with a modified gauntlet – called the Fist – on the arm of their choosing.

The Fist was made of pure bronze, and worn over a ropes-wrapped hand. Welded into a solid bludgeon, it not have the mobility of a standard gauntlet and was more of a club. Because of this, the selected arm was handicapped but also capable of significantly more powerful strikes. Grappling was allowed, but generally limited.

When performed by humans, the Fist is often made of another, lighter material and strikes to the head and certain other areas of the body are illegal.

### Calcio

Calcio was a team-based Hand-to-Hand contest rather than a one-on-one sport, with each competitor choosing either wrestling or strike boxing prior to the match start. Unlike the other Elven combat sports, calcio also involved a ball and goal which – over the course of the often days-long contest – would be pitched up and down a long rectangular field – another distinguishing feature of the sport.

Wrestlers would grapple opponents – temporarily taking both parties out of the match – and were generally used as proficient defenders and midfielders. Boxers would play up and down the field, primarily in attacking positions, but also defending the midfield and the goal with their powerful strikes.

Team members could be close comrades who repeatedly compete together, a group of relative strangers chosen to form a team, or an amalgamation of several smaller teams. Generally, competitors worked as independent agents – picking and abandoning fights with opponents as they chose – and only reconvening with their teammates for collaboration in moments of opportunity.

Calcio matches were treated as a big event, both by the Elves and their human companions. Though they could be and were often put on as smaller matches, the format preferred by both competitors and watchers-on was larger contests. It was common for stays in larger settlements to be bookended by two great matches.

## Armed Sports

Armed combat sports were more common in the Legion's higher ranks. They were generally less ceremonial in nature, but more effective as training for live combat.

### Spear

Spears, as the preferred weapon of the Legion's Elves, featured prominently in sporting contest. The many spearing arts took a simple polearm into an instrument capable of killing or maiming in hundreds of different ways: stabbing strikes, devastating slashes, piercing throws, and even elements of what humans would later develop into stick fighting.

There existed many different forms of spears, a great many more than humanity would ever adopt. These forms were varied in shaft length, grip, and flexibility, as well as blade shape and length.

### Blade Dancing

Blade dancing was a combat sport encompassing the Legion's many blade arts. Competitors used knives, swords, spears, and anything else with a cutting blade. Thrown blades were used, but comprised their own specific blade arts as this approach necessitated the retrieval of a competitor's limited ammunition mid-combat.

### Mounted Jousting

The Legion rarely used mounts with the exception of certain races of Noble Beasts, but mounted jousting was a popular sport and particularly well suited for larger events due to the spectacle it created.
