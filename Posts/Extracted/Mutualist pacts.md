# Mutualist pacts

---
Mutualist [[Pact magics|pacts]] are formed between two living beings of relatively equal [[albedo]] rather than between an [[iconic pacts|iconic mage]] and a patron [[Aspect]]. Typically significantly closer in relative magics, both parties benefit greatly from this relationship. Mutualist pacts are most commonly formed between the races of the [[Orior]] and a race of the [[Discoveries in the Known World#noble beasts|noble beasts]].
