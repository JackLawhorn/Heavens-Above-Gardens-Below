# Transportation in the Known World

## Instantaneous travel

Methods of instantaneous travel are far and few between even in the infinities of the [[Nyx]]. The [[Laws of Power]] – which the [[Sun Elves]] had no name for but [[Cult of Pythos#Pythos|Pythos]] named Space and Time – are sturdy and to defy them is [[paradoxy]], heresy against the Nyx itself.

As such, it is only [[Ylem]] themselves who may inflict this chaos upon the Nyx. Many are well known to flit across the [[Known World]] on a whim or even exist in multiple states at once – their form [[docetic]] rather than physical in nature – but may also extend similar abilities to their [[Pact magics|patrons]]. The [[Lunar Aspects#The White Owl|White Owl moon]], whose children see all and protect truth itself, are only [[Noble beasts]] themselves but have been reported to fly directly into the reflections of mirrors and other surfaces.

The humans and the other races of the [[Orior]] are only known to have one method of instantaneous travel available to them: the [[Elven March|March]] through which the [[Elven Legion]] made [[nyxfall]] upon the Known World. The March opens a pathway through Space and Time, bending the Laws of Power to their very breaking point. But even the Elves fear the Pathway ahead for it is a paradox: a living blight upon reality and a hole in the membrane between reality and unreality. It is a mercy that marches through the Nyx are not remembered afterwards, for the outskirts of Time and Space are infinite and perilous. The Elven Legion anticipates a loss of 20 percent of its ranks with every March.

## Mounts

Though the [[Sun Elves]] were proficient in collaborating with the simple beasts of the [[Known World]] just as they did with the [[Orior]] and the [[Noble beasts]], their stature made riding and especially mounted combat impractical. Along the path of humanity's [[Elven March|March]] with the [[Elven Legion]], several of the creatures they came across were able to be mounted.

Typically, human mounts are informed by the terrain and environment first:
- Horses or stags are most popular in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and for travel to the colonies of the [[Questing Houses]] to the north
- Oxen for caravan journeys hauling a trove of supplies and goods over longer, slower trips, such as the [[Questing Charter]] of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]]
- Goats are more effective than horses along the cliffs and crags to the northwest
- Camels or dune-runner lizards to traverse the [[Deep Deserts]] beyond the northern plains when humanity returned there in the [[Later Renascence period]]
- Only the jacana are able to traverse the gargantuan lilies that have conquered much of the eastern wetlands
- Giant sunrays are used by humans across the Known World to surf above or dive below the waves of the [[Sink]]

## Land vehicles

It was along the [[Elven March]] that the first land vehicles were created in the form of simple carts and wagons that could be pulled by horse or oxen or stag. Their [[cland]] inventors would go on to refine these designs after the founding of[[ Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] in the [[Later Heliotropic Age]] as humankind settled in one place for the first time. Working with the mounted [[human clans|clans]] and [[House|Houses]] such as the [[Agisters Guild]] and their [[Agisters Guild#stag knights|stag knights]], they invented chariots, coaches, and other land vehicles.

Their descendants would go on to form the [[Shipwrights Guild]] in the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]]. Although they are perhaps best known for their nautical vessels, they have a rich history in all forms of vehicular engineering.

During the [[Red Death]] and in the aftermath of the [[Burning]] which brought it to its end, the first exodus of people from the City would spur a modified wagon called a caravan. The first and most prominent use of these were on the [[Questing Charter]] of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] who traveled north along the [[Gold Coast]] to the [[Deep Deserts]].

The [[Renascence]] saw significant advancements as it did in all areas. Coaches grew in popularity among the wealthier Houses and the [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] of the [[Court]]. For the rest of the populace, bicycles and other pedaled vehicles for short-to-mid-range transport were an effective way to traverse the streets and [[rayas]] of the City. Around the [[Later Renascence period]], explorers come to the Deep Deserts to the north in pursuit of the [[Pretender]] and their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] famously tamed the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind motes]] there to pilot [[Deep Deserts#sandships|sandships]] over the treacherous dunes of the region.

The [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]] would see the invention of the steam engine, used not only in nautical steamships but also the steam train which allowed for high-speed travel and connected the City to its colonies to the north. The [[Later Post-Enlightenment Era]] will see the invention of a more compact steam engine which will introduce motorwagons, motorcoaches, motorcaravans, and motorbikes to the public consciousness.

## Nautical vehicles

The first nautical vessels developed by humanity were simple, flat-bottomed platforms. These platforms could and would go on to serve a wide range of purposes in and around [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Their simple design meant that they could be customized for use on either the river or at sea, anchored or for transportation. At first, they were pulled by a rope or chain system and could only travel a short distance, but members of the [[human clans]] learned from the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|mind motes]] and would go on to invent the earliest sails which enabled longer-distance travel.

Though platforms continued to be used for upbound travel north from the delta to the east and in the shallows along the coastline, the roiling waves of the [[Sink]] made them less effective in the open ocean. It wouldn’t be until the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]] that the first true sailing ships would be developed. Though few humans have ever formed pacts with the elemental wind and [[Mundial Aspects#water motes|water motes]], the inventors of the [[Houses of Industry]] learned much from them to design strange, curved hull profiles that allowed even larger, multi-deck vessels to float. Though this design has obviously been adopted for river travel as well, it had a profound impact on sea travel.

Soon after the departure of [[House Lightbringer]] on their [[Quest into Oblivion]], this development led to growing demand for [[Questing Charter|Questing Charters]] to far-off lands. The Shipwrights Guild quickly ramped up production, and soon there were hundreds of ships anchored off-shore of the City and its newly founded [[Barony of Stilts]] waiting to leave on their maiden voyages. The first and only of these ships to leave would be the very same that retrieved the remnants of the [[Fallen Houses|Fallen House]] and brought the [[Red Court]] and their [[Red Death|plague]] back to the City. The image of hundreds of brand new, practically unused ships sitting off-shore is incorporated near universally in art from or depicting this period. It wasn't until [[Reconstruction]] in the [[Early Renascence period]] that the promise of long-distance human sea travel was realized in earnest.

The invention of the steamship immediately predated the invention of the steam train in the [[Later Renascence period]], and is one of the primary milestones considered to demark the end of the [[Renascence]] and beginning of the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]]. Though not as fast as the steam train was on land, the steam engine technology drew power from the sciences rather than from magic, removing the need for sails. They connected the City to its new colonies across the [[Great Sea]] – both a number of remote island colonies and settlements along the northern coast of the [[Beastlands]] on the far shores to the south.

## Aeronautic vehicles

With the development of long-range communication over radio transmission in the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]], aeronautics became a hot new field of study and industry. Just a century later, the skies above [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and the surrounding regions will be dotted with airships and aerostatics kept aloft by hot and low-density gases. Although the great size and expense of these aeronautic vehicles would limit its civilian use, they would quickly be put to use in industry, colonial [[Questing Charter|Questing Charters]], exploration and intelligence gathering, and of course warfare.
