## Denominations

### Gold

In addition to the [[Standard Elven Cosmology]], the [[Elven Legion]] brought with them to the [[Known World]] a rich tapestry of factual history, myth, parables, and symbolism. One prominent example to have embedded itself in humanity's own culture is gold as a symbol of light, [[nyxfire]], and [[Ylem]]. Consequently, by second-order symbolism, gold quickly became associated with good fortune, health, and wealth.

Though they did not have formal currency of their own, the oldest Elves of the Legion would have acquired several golden trinkets and bobbles, adorning their person, helping to identify one from another, and indicating their position in the Legion's societal and military hierarchy.

After the [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founding]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|since-fallen]] [[Oremongers Guild]] was quick to leverage their access to vast deposits of gold, spreading their product throughout the [[House|Houses]] of the young [[Court]] and establishing the gold standard. As of the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era|Early]] [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], gold coins are primarily held by the Houses of the Court, their [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] and cabinets, and the privately wealthy.

### Copper coins

Copper coins were introduced by the [[Oremongers Guild]] soon after the successful adoption of the [[#Gold|gold standard]], flooding the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]] and its economy with newfound wealth. Just as gold had held significant symbolism for the [[Sun Elves|Elves]] and humanity after them, copper had long since been associated with the Sun Elves themselves. Not only were their arms and armor made of bronze, but copper also evoked the shared skin tone of the Sun Elves.

This new denomination brought much prosperity and increased quality of life to the middle and lower classes, and further defined the structure of the [[Class and caste|social classes]]. As of the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era|Early]] [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], copper coins are predominantly held by the middle class.

### Silver

Long kept by [[Clan Wolfstepper]] and their [[Silver Wolves]], [[docetic]] fragments of the [[Posts/Iconic pact of the Silver Wolves.md#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]]'s [[Lunar Aspects|lunar form]] were far too valuable a material to be used as mere currency. After their [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] however, the [[Orator]] – in her pettiness and rage – melted the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s remaining silver down into the lowest denominations of currency, effectively making them impossible to fully retrieve.

Silver has now been divided into full coins, as well as even smaller denominations – named hastas and crescents after the phases of the moon their shapes evoke. As of the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era|Early]] [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], silver coins are primarily held by the lower classes and most infamously the beggars, thieves, and silversmiths of the oppressed remnants of the Clan.

## Rituals surrounding currency

### Counterfeit currency

Across most of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]], [[#Gold|gold coins]] are a rare sight and paying with them – especially if one does not look to be wealthy – is quite conspicuous. It is common practice for merchants to smell gold coins to check their veracity. This is in reference to "[[devil]]'s gold", another name for [[brimstone]] (sulfur), which is commonly used in the creation of counterfeit currency. Brimstone has a distinct smell, though its pungency is dependent on purity.

### Silver in the Argent Ghetto

Those of [[Clan Wolfstepper]] who do still worship the [[Posts/Iconic pact of the Silver Wolves.md#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]] have spent generations begging on the street in hopes of amassing enough [[#Silver|silver]] in change so that they may reclaim their goddess. This change is smelted in secret, forming community reserves that are worshipped as a corpse being willed to life.
