# Silver

---

Silver is a [[docetic materials|docetic material]] closely tied to the [[Wolf Mother]], [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]] and [[Iconic pacts|patron]] to all predators of the land, chunks of her [[silver moon|lunar form]] come crashing down to the [[Known World]]. As such it has historically been kept close by the children of the Wolf Mother – [[Clan Wolfstepper]] and their [[Silver Wolves]] – until their [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]].

It has a number of [[#Properties and applications|valuable attributes]] and very notably is used in the [[Silvered|silvering]] of arms and armor and now as a form of [[Currencies of the City|currency]] within [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

## Properties and applications

Silver is white in color and is the most reflective metal, with high density and resistance to oxidation. It has the highest thermal conductivity of all known metals, and thus is often cold to the touch. It has a very low melting point, and was easily forged along the [[Elven March]] by the early [[Silver Wolves]] of the [[Heliotropic Age]].

Even among the other [[docetic materials]], silver has particularly high transfer rate of [[Albedo]]. This makes it suitable for a number of practical applications including for [[#cleansing properties|cleansing]] and the [[silvered|silvering]] of arms and armor.

### Cleansing properties

The high [[Albedo]] of silver makes it an effective tool in healing and cleansing. Since the [[Elven March]], silver trinkets specially crafted by the silversmiths and sages of [[Clan Wolfstepper]] have been used by humanity at large to purify water for drinking. A single [[Currencies of the City#silver|silver hasta]] is capable of cleansing a large tankard of drinking water.

A wide variety of healing creams and powders are also available, especially within the Clan and their surviving [[cland]] culture.

### Silvered arms and armor

> For more, see [[silvered]].

[[Silvered]] arms and armor are treated with a small amount of [[Docetic materials#Silver|silver]]. This might mean creating a weapon with a core of silver and a mundane outer layer, a spear that ends in a small silver tip, or a blade dipped in a silver coating. This process extends a modicum of the [[docetic materials|docetic material]]'s [[extramundane]] properties to the weapon.

### Silver and Clan Wolfstepper

Silver has a number of additional and unique [[extramundane]] properties specifically when held by the children of [[Clan Wolfstepper]], who hold an iconic pact with the [[Wolf Mother]]. Their connection to the [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]] makes their arms and armor of pure silver more effective, and such equipment is even able to be worn between both their human and wolf forms.

## Silver as currency

After the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of the [[Silver Wolves]], the reserves of silver left behind by the [[New Silver Age]] has been split into smaller and smaller pieces and spread throughout [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] in a number of different forms but none so iconic as the [[Currencies of the City#silver|silver coins, hastas, and crescents]] which are the lowliest denominations of [[Currencies of the City|currency in the City]]. Now, in the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]], silver coins are primarily held by the lower classes and most infamously the beggars, thieves, and silversmiths of the oppressed remnants of the Clan within the [[Argent Ghetto]].
