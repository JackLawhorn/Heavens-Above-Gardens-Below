# Social Sphere Theory

## Social spheres of the Elven Legion

The life and philosophy of the [[Elven Legion]] revolved around what they referred to as the Spheres, a term taken from their own [[Standard Elven Cosmology]]. Elven life and society, in many ways simpler than human life, consisted of only the Spheres of War and Law.

The Sphere of War, in truth representing the sole purpose of their race's existence, encompassed lethal combat and survival, as well as reproduction and even the arts which were fundamentally seen as fuel for victory in the eternal conflict known as the [[roiling of the Nyx]].

The Sphere of Law represented most facets of Elven society and culture outside of combat and outside of the [[Elven March|March]], including hierarchy of the Legion, resolution of personal disputes and other internal conflict, and the area of sports and contest.

## Social spheres in the City

Human philosophers of the [[Later Heliotropic Age]] found their newly rebuilt society to revolve around the intersection of five Primary Spheres of Politics, Knowledge, Industry, Worship, and the Subjective.

#### Sphere of Politics

The Sphere of Politics is a reflection of the [[#Social spheres of the Elven Legion|Elven Sphere of Law]] as it encompasses the hierarchy of human society and the interactions of the entities within that hierarchy, from the [[Great House|Great Houses]] to the [[Court]] down to the individual. It describes the role of politicians like the [[Orator|Orators]], the [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] and their cabinets, and the many political agents of the [[Psionics College]], but also laws – written or unwritten – of humanity and their [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] and the justice that enforces them.

### Sphere of Knowledge

The Sphere of Knowledge is that of the many [[Scholars of the City|scholars]] of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] and in particular its [[College|colleges]]. It encompasses all of what would come to be known as [[The Objective]]: the measurable phenomena of our reality, our understanding of those phenomena, and the nature, history, and current state of that reality.

### Sphere of Industry

The Sphere of Industry encompasses what humanity has wrought with its understanding of [[The Objective]] of the [[#Sphere of Knowledge]], including the works of the many [[Houses of Industry]] which govern the life-giving crafts of agriculture, construction, metalworking, invention, commerce, expansion, et cetera. Save for the politicians and the scholars, near everyone in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] is employed by one House of Industry or another.

### Sphere of Worship

The Sphere of Worship is that of religion, supplication to the divine, and the connection between humanity and the [[Ylem]] through their many [[iconic pacts]]. The [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]] is a sprawl comprised almost entirely of [[Great Works]] born of [[Henotheist|Henotheistic]] worship, from the [[Elven Signaltower]] to the visages of [[Aspect|Aspects]] that adorn the city walls, public squares, and many titular gardens. Because of this, the Sphere of Worship plays a significant impact in that of [[#Sphere of Politics|Politics]] through the instrument of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]].

### Sphere of the Subjective

The Sphere of the Subjective encompasses all of what would come to be known as [[The Subjective]], opposite to [[The Objective]] of the [[#Sphere of Knowledge]] as the ephemeral, unintended byproduct of the [[#Sphere of Politics]]. It is the realm of artists and philosophers, who explore the more complex, immeasurable truths.

### Secondary Spheres

In addition to the [[#Primary Spheres]] defined by the [[History of the Subjective#Subjectivism|Subjectivists]] of the [[Mouseion]], the modern ages after the [[Crisis of Hubris]] – the [[Renascence]] and now the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]] – have given way to so-called Secondary Spheres:

| | Knowledge | Industry | Worship | Subjective |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Politics | Intelligence | Commerce | Law and Justice | Propaganda
| Knowledge | - | Communication | Cosmography | Philosophy
| Industry | - | - | Great Works | Art
| Worship | - | - | - | Sport and Contest
| Subjective | - | - | - | -
