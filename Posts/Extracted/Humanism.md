# Humanism

---

The humans of the [[Heliotropic Age]] and its [[Elven March|Elven March period]] developed around the [[Elven Legion]], who walked like gods amongst them. Many aspects of human society and culture are artifacts left over from this relationship, and none more so than the race's quest for apotheosis. This served as the primary driver for the human mages seeking to borrow – or even steal – power that should be beyond them and that would enable them to do great works in this [[Known World]]. Throughout the [[Crisis of Hubris]], this [[Quest into Oblivion]] would result in catastrophic defeat after catastrophic defeat, demarked by the fall of the five [[Great House|Great Houses]].

In the [[Reconstruction]] that followed the [[Burning]] that ended the [[Red Death period]], both the newly in-power [[House of the Sun]] and [[Scholars of the City#Subjectivists|subjectivist]] human philosophers gravitated towards the idea of humanism which embraced the natural abilities and potential of humanity separate from external sources of power. Endeavors described as humanist typically exist outside of the [[Social Spheres Theory#Sphere of Worship|Sphere of Worship]]. Now at the precipice of the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], humanism evokes thoughts of the [[Earthen Orders]], the [[witches]] and their [[Hexecraft pacts|hexecraft]], and both the [[Psionics College]] and the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] before them.
