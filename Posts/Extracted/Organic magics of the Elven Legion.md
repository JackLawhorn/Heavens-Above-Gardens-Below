# Organic magics of the Elven Legion

> The assertions made in these materials are based on accounts taken from oral history during [[Reconstruction]] and later verified in interviews with the remnants of the [[Elven Legion]]. See the [[History of materialist magics#The Red Death period|anatomists]]' notes on the mechanics of [[organic magics]], free for scholastic use under [[Public Scholarship]] law.

## Divine evolution

The Elves of the Legion are the byproduct of the divine evolution of the [[Angels]], a world created and seeded for them and their development into a race of [[Nyxfarer|nyxfaring]] warriors. Their anatomy is perfectly bioengineered to this purpose and as precise as clockwork.

Adult Elves are imposing figures, standing between two and three strides tall with extreme musculature, though body types can vary between efficiently lean and monstrously bulky based on weapons and fighting styles of choice. They possess heightened senses and reflexes. Their skin is more durable than human skin, so much so that it is not uncommon for blade edges to glance off of it.

At the same time, their race is lacking in biodiversity, significantly homogenous in looks and anatomy. Many of their characteristics, including their language and thought patterns, are streamlined as much as possible.

## Albedo and nyxfire

Along with their outwardly apparent characteristics, their connection and access to the purest magics of [[Ylem]] are heightened such as to be unparalleled by all but the [[Angels]] themselves. Their [[Albedo]] and the [[Albedo#aura|aura]] it comprises allow them to tap into these energies.

For the [[Sun Elves]] and [[Storm Elves]], this means the ability to summon the elemental [[nyxfire motes]] and to wield their raw flames and sharpened bolts respectively. The [[Sea Elves]] – in their own battleground in the roiling undersea of the Sink – instead wield the harsh light of Ylem to push back the darkness.

## The Elven tongue

Perhaps the most ubiquitous of the Elven magics is their tongue, a divinely perfect language that infects other peoples so as to be naturally and universally understandable. This gift has not only facilitated conversation between the Legion and the many races of the [[Orior]] and the noble beasts, but also to unify them with a single shared language.

Like the other products of their divine evolution, this tongue is streamlined, simplified, with lexical gaps not typically found in naturally-formed languages. Though later adopted by each of the [[Known World]]'s races of the [[Orior]], dialects would form to incorporate metaphor, colloquialisms, and to adapt to their own environments, cultures, and lifestyles.
