# The Cumbergrounds

---

It is no secret among the peoples of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] that the criminal element has proliferated throughout the poorer, lower-class district known as the Cumbergrounds. This area of economic inequality has spread through the City like a sickness, starting in the [[Red Quarter]] which was rebuilt after the [[Burning]] of the [[Red Death period]]. Since then, other, neighboring areas of the City have seen similar descents, including the [[Argent Ghetto]] and the [[Barony of Stilts#Shoals|Shoals]] in the [[Barony of Stilts]].

## The criminal element

The [[Jurisweard]] is afforded only limited jurisdiction by the inhabitants of these neighborhoods, who rely on each other to enforce law and order there. Because of this, certain criminal factions find refuge within the Cumbergrounds.

The [[Rookish clans#Rookish Cloaks|Rookish Cloaks]] are easily the most prominent perpetrators of wide-spread organized crime. The Cloaks are often seen retreating to the alleyways and rooftops of the Cumbergrounds before disappearing from peering eyes. Their shrouded appearance and quiet protection from even the politically legitimate [[Rookish clans]] make identifying and prosecuting them near impossible after they've made such a getaway.

Defected Jurisweard [[Bloodhounds]] and others who have escaped the ghettos of Clan Wolfstepper are also able to find not only refuge but also sympathy and aid from their neighbors. Outside of the Cumbergrounds, particularly over-eager agents of the Jurisweard might identify such a fugitive by a simple reaction to a [[Currencies of the City#Silver|silver coin]]. Here they blend in among the other downtrodden peoples of humanity, getting away from their cursed bloodline and the hardships and persecution that come with it.

More recently, the Cumbergrounds have served as a much-needed safe harbor for those who found themselves on the losing side of the [[Vergonic War]]. One of the more significant social and cultural conflicts in the history of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]], these individuals have had to fight public perception and hide their identities and allegiances even from the peoples of the Cumbergrounds.
