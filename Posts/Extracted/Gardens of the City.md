# Gardens of the City

---

The titular gardens of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]], upon which it was first [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founded]], dot the [[rota]] and lend the spaces between the white of its [[wol stone]] an evergreen hue of verdant green. They cover rooftops, span what would otherwise be alleyways and through streets, and fill in almost every gap of usable space.

All of the disparate natives of the City do their part to maintain the gardens, and in return they reap herbs and produce and raw materials for various industries. Some are strictly communal while others are proprietary to specific factions, generally those built on or around that faction's territory.

## Inhabitants of the gardens

Maintained by botanists and gardeners and agriculturists of nearly every [[Human clans|clan]] and [[House]], the gardens are places of worship to the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] and to the natural wonders of the [[Known World]]. They serve as a home to a great many races of [[Noble beasts]], as well as simple beasts who have come to adapt to the urban environment.

The swarms of the [[Apiarians Guild]] and the flocks of the [[Rookish clans]] serve a vital role in pollinating the flora of the gardens. The former has also grown to prominence as a [[House of Industry]] through their wildly popular honeys which they can be found selling up and down the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s [[rayas]].

The naturalists of the [[Agisters Guild]], who prefer the familiarity of the forests to the cramped urban sprawl, tend to trees and bring back new species of flora from their excursions outside the City walls. Their elk mounts call these gardens home when not in service to their [[Mutualist pacts|mutualist companions]] the [[Agisters Guild#stag knights|stag knights]].

The [[The Maw#Undergardeners|Undergardeners]], previously of the [[Oremongers Guild]] and who now tend to the gardens of [[the Maw]]. This work has helped to diminish the ire of the greater populace despite their status as [[Remnants of the Fallen Houses|remnants]] of a [[Fallen House]] and as [[Warlock|warlocks]].

More recently, the [[Procyon gaze]] have taken to the gardens of the City, though their detractors among the populace do not approve of their use of them as living spaces or their predilection towards stealing produce.
