## Sex and relationships

Sexual relationships are fleeting, occurring between friends and strangers alike, but sex is rarely for pleasure because of how heavily regulated libido and fertility are.

Long-term romantic or familial relationships are uncommon, though strategic partnerships may fulfil many of the same roles. Elves pick mates primarily based on physical prowess and combat skill, and sexual relationships based on complementary traits and with the goal of siring more optimal offspring are very common. Potential sexual partners are most often identified in combat, when these traits are on display.

## The family unit

Fellow squad members are the most important to any Elf, often serving in the place of roles like best friends or immediate family. Depending on their standing orders, Elves may go months seeing no one other than these two closest comrades. When many units are stationed or marching together, squad-mates and sister squads will stick close to one another, always watching each other's backs.

Within each squad, there is a leader who will serve the role of eldest brother. These Elves are the oldest and most battled-hardened of the triad, and they will receive a significant amount of respect from their kin. This hierarchy permeates the entire Elven military organization, and the leadership roles given to Unit Leaders are often extended to their most immediate comrades as well.

To summarize the above: the closeness of personal relationships is based on degree of separation within the military organization and leadership radiates out from unit Leaders. This system more or less plays the role of human family units. Inheritance of possessions falls first to the fallen Elf's squad. There is very little precedent for Elves leaving wills rather than relying on the traditional military structure as a means of distributing their earthly possessions, but it may happen if they have spent significant time among populations of other races who do. Leadership of the unit leader is inherited by the eldest and most battle-hardened comrade in their Squad.

## The Elven classes

Position in the hierarchy is earned and proven in battle, and upwards movement within that hierarchy is a major drive among the Elves. Like a wolf who can smell the alpha of another pack among the lesser, this class is instinctually understood rather than needing to be shown.

Of course, the Elves are known for their living oral history and those victorious warriors who work their way up the class system will more often than not accrue scars and trophies to commemorate their own lives. A non-Elf can recognize a unit leader or a particularly high-ranking soldier by their personalized weapons which stand out from the uniform masses around them: a golden suit of armor, an custom-engraved weapon, tattoos and piercings that hold special meanings to them. Those who sit outside the typical hierarchy such as caretakers, blacksmiths, and Griots are more easily identifiable by their attire and tools.

Adjacent to the military hierarchy, however, is the shaft of the spear by which the lethal spearhead is leveraged against the enemy. This secondary class system is made up of young Elven squires, master hunters and blacksmiths, and the powerful Griot who acts as keeper of the living oral history of the race. For the most part these roles are viewed by Elven soldiers as lesser than their own calling, and a child who grows up to become a full-time hunter rather than a soldier is enough to dissuade many from selecting the parent as a mate. Blacksmiths, and particularly master armorers, are of a higher standing. Griots may have higher standing than even most soldiers, and nearly every high-ranking unit leader will have a Griot close to them as a source of strategic advice and inspiration.

## Temporary settlements

For the most part the life of an Elf is nomadic, constantly marching to the next battlefield. Settlements are all but temporary camps, built up after a few days of marching and broken down soon after. Depending on the time and resources a marching party has available to them, the entire unit may sleep on the ground and under the stars or have set up a small town's worth of tents. When more time is available, the average Elven soldier will spend their time drinking, training, engaging in competitions of strength with their fellow soldiers, and mating if necessary.

Within the settlement, Elves will self-organize themselves based on position in the military hierarchy. Soldiers in the same Unit will be closer together and squad-mates will remain closest. Craftsmen and other non-soldiers will set up shop close to the hub of the settlement where the highest-ranking Elves reside. Their services are available to all so many Elves will compete to take advantage of them, but the needs of higher-ranking Elves take priority and often take up all available time and resources, leaving little for anyone else. This structure is consistent with every new encampment built, and navigating these communities becomes almost instinctual.

## Interpersonal conflict

The majority of potential conflict between the Elves themselves is averted by their instinctual understanding of their standing and combat prowess as they compare to those around them. Elves will rarely intentionally start conflict with a superior, and more often than not will respect their superiority and whatever orders they deliver. Likewise, high ranking soldiers will generally respect their inferiors, listen to their input, and have a calm conversation when necessary. The military encompasses every aspect of Elven life, and the chain of command its structure creates has a great impact on nearly every decision made.

When conflict resolution does prove necessary, a duel or contest of skill is often the go-to solution. Masters of combat, only the greatest conflicts end in a duel to the death. Instead, Elves have an instinctual understanding of when superiority has been proven, and a third-party can make their final verdict anywhere between the first strike and hours into combat. These referees will either be the duelists' closest shared superior or a Griot, who will be able to recognize a completed duel better than anyone.

In the case of conflict between a superior and one of their inferiors, the last resort is usually banishment. Once banished from the Elven military, one's ties to others of the race are more or less severed completely. Some banished Elves, among those who do not choose death over their sentence, will settle as advisors to Human kings, but most hide walk the earth alone. These ronin may live in solidarity, or offer their services as sellswords and mercenaries.
