# The Rookish clans

---

A great many of the [[human clans]] formed bonds with the avian races of the [[Noble beasts]] who are great in number due to their closeness to the [[Nyx]]. These clans came to be known as the Rookish clans, some of humanity's oldest that still stand now in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]].

## Abilities

Just as their [[Noble beasts|noble beast]] companions are able to glide without a sound, the Rooks have learned to traverse any environment cautiously and stealthily. Their boots and their [[#bird-hamir]] make them nearly as silent at the [[Psionics College|College]]'s [[Agents of the Psionics College#College Silencers|Silencers]].

In order to better hunt like their companions, the early Rooks also learned their near [[extramundane]] climbing abilities from the [[Sun Elves]].

### Raptor eyes

The Rooks are best known for their [[extramundane]] vision and accuracy, especially by moonlight. Empowered by raptor eyes gained through their [[Mutualist pacts]], they are expert hunters and masters of the ranged [[Combat Arts]].

## Rookish heritage

The Rooks learned a great many things from their companions. The form of their beaks and feathers inspired the invention of arrows, throwing knives, cloaks, and feather scale armor known as [[#bird-hamir]] – all distinct from any Elven equipment or [[Combat Arts]].

Though they share many of these traits, each Rookish house or clan borrows aesthetic from their companions that make them visually and distinct.

### Birdsong

Each Rookish clan commands an encoded language of its own known as "birdsong". Rookish birdsong is often heard throughout [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], though it is often indistinguishable from the song of the birds themselves.

### Bird-hamir

Mimicking in color the plumage of one's [[Noble beasts|noble beast]] companions, these vestments are colorful and deep ingrained in the visual language of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. These, along with their [[#visages]], serve as identifying features, from which a layman can ascertain one's Rookish clan and fellow Rooks may even recognize one individual from another.

### Visages

Below the hoods of their [[#bird-hamir]] sit the Rookish masks – called visors or visages – which serve a number of purposes. Each visage is made by hand by its wearer, and can communicate ones identity, station, and alliances by sight alone. The [[#Rookish Cloaks]] take full advantage of these masks to hide their faces when committing crimes around the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]], making them both identifying features and effective disguises in different contexts.

Many among humanity find the raptor eyes to be frightening or suspicious, and most have trouble holding conversations with a Rook without their visor. For centuries, superstitions of their "much suffering" eyes have kept their non-Rookish neighbors at an arms length. For this reason, a visage can also be a necessary tool to navigate a social interaction – when they are not keeping to themselves that is.

Finally, the visages help focus the Rooks, narrowing the [[extramundane]] vision of their [[#raptor eyes]] like blinders on a mounted beast.

## Talons

The Rooks are also wielders of the talons, bladed gauntlets with which they are proficient in combat and that are a boon to their climbing abilities. These and other short blade weapons are common equipment of the Rooks, who are masters of the short blade [[Combat Arts]].

## The Rookish classes
### Raptors

The Raptors are humanity's second greatest hunters after the [[Silver Wolves]] themselves, possessing powerful [[#raptor eyes]] to see their prey, near-[[extramundane]] climbing and stealth abilities to approach them, and powerful ranged and close quarters [[Combat Arts]] to dispatch them.

### Augurs

The Rookish augurs are secret-keepers and spies who hear all the goings on of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] through their avian companions. In the [[Later Heliotropic Age]], it was rumored that the augurs possessed divination like that of the Elven [[Griot|Griots]] due to the accuracy of their reconnaissance-informed predictions.

The augurs control the City's [[roccas]] and hear of all her goings on.

### Rookish Cloaks

Rookish Cloaks used their [[extramundane]] climbing abilities and the urban environment of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] to their advantage. It is an open secret that a great many thieves and assassins are in fact associated with the various Rookish Clans, and that these Cloaks control much of the [[Cumbergrounds]], an impoverished City district which overlaps with the [[Red Quarter]] and the [[Argent Ghetto]].
