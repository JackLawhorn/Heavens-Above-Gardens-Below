# The Pretender

---

The Pretender was the first human [[psion]], who's [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revelation]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] ushered in the [[Psionic Age]]. Able to awaken the [[psionics#psionic influence|psionic influence]] in others, the Pretender is responsible for the rapid growth of [[psionics]] among the human population in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and across the [[Known World]]. Their sect of psionics is known today as [[mystic psionics]], rather than the more [[Scholars of the City#objectivists|objectivist]] approach of the [[Psionics College]].

They quickly amassed a following of loyal [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]], growing to become a [[cults|cult]] larger than any [[Iconic House]] of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] and who were able to gain not only [[House|Houseship]] but [[Great House|Great Houseship]]. Ultimately, the Pretender and their Disciples fell to the [[Deep Deserts#mirage|mirages]] of the [[Deep Deserts]] on a [[Questing Charter of the Pretender|religious pilgrimage]] that proved a [[Quest into Oblivion]].

## Life of the Pretender

### Origin and early life

The true origin of the Pretender is unknown, with accounts only reaching as far back as the night of the great [[Burning]] which brought the [[Red Death period]] to its end. Rescued from [[Red Death period City of Gardens#enemy territory|enemy territory]] behind the [[Red Death period City of Gardens#The warding line|warding line]] by an [[Apotropaics|Apotropaic]], they would go to live in one of the many underserved orphanages of the time.

When it was discovered that the child held what was thought to be some form of magics without either [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]] or [[Materialist magics|materialist]] trinkets, they were brought to the [[Silver Wolves]] to be studied and trained. There, they lived in secret for most of their childhood, developing new abilities the likes of which humanity had never seen: [[Psionics#Psionic communication|psionic communication]], [[psionics#hallucination|illusion]], and seemingly prophetic visions called [[#Scivias of the Pretender|scivias]].

Ultimately, they came to live in the home of the [[House of the Sun]]'s [[Orator]] as her own child.

### Revelation of the Pretender

After a familial spat with their adoptive mother, the [[Orator]] of the [[House of the Sun]], the Pretender – now a young adult – broke out from the captive watch of their guard, free from their secretive life lived only with the agents of the [[Great House|Great Houses]], and [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revealed]] themself to the wider human population in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

> For an account of these events, see [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III]].

### Disciples of the Pretender in the City

Within hours of [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revealing]] themself to the humanity in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[Pretender]] had amassed dozens of [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]]. A people without [[organic magics]] of their own, humanity was eager to believe in the opportunity for exultation and [[psionics]] appeared almost as a miracle to these early Disciples. The revelation of the Pretender and of the field of psionics brought about the [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of what is now called the [[Psionic Age]].

Under the stewardship of the [[Pretender]] and their Disciples, [[mystic psionics]] grew into a sizable [[cults|cult]] quickly spreading both [[Psionics#Psionic influence|psionic influence]] and [[belief in the Pretender]] throughout the human population. These early [[Psion|psions]] formed classes like the [[Mystic psionics#Psiknights|Psiknights]], [[Mystic psionics#dwaalstepper|dwaalsteppers]], and [[Mystic psionics#Illusionist|illusionists]], and soon the entire City was populated by their camps and tents and transformed by their [[Psionics#Hallucination|illusions]]. Their works – spectacles though they may have been – helped to heal the wounds of a humanity still recovering from the losses of the [[Red Death period]] and the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]] of the [[Materialists College]].

### Questing Charter and fall of the Pretender

Some years after their [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revelation]] to humanity, the [[Pretender]] announced to their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] plans to argue for a [[Questing Charter]]. There existed a beacon, they said, on the northern horizon: a place where the membrane between the [[Psionic Sphere]] and the [[Prime Material Sphere]] was thin. Standing before the [[Orator|Orators]] of the [[Great House|Great Houses]] and the [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] of all the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]], the Pretender outlined a march north along the [[Gold Coast]] and into the [[Deep Deserts]] where no human had ever ventured. There, they said, laid the future of not only the human [[Psion|psions]] but of all of humanity.

[[Questing Charter of the Pretender|Their Questing Charter]] was ultimately granted with majority support in Court. Though the Great Houses and their Orators were among the detractors – which most notably also included the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] – they formulated a plan to deal with their rising power. The Disciples of the Pretender had their Questing Charter granted and were also named as the sixth Great House of the Court, ensuring access to the resources needed for such a [[quest]].

Ultimately, this religious pilgrimage proved a [[Quest into Oblivion]], and led to the [[Fall of the Pretender]]. Only a handful of the Disciples survived to return to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] with the news, and the fall of yet another Great House was moralized just as much as the others.

## Psionic abilities of the Pretender

The Pretender held an unprecedented connection to the [[Psionic Sphere]] and the greatest [[psionics#psionic influence|psionic influence]] of any [[psion]] in recorded history, save perhaps for [[Gljiva, the Conquering Fungus]]. From an early age, they developed mastery of [[psionics#psionic communication|psionic communication]] and later [[psionics#Hallucination|illusions]], but also held a number of unique [[psionics#psionic abilities|psionic abilities]] that still have not been entirely explained by the scholars of the [[Psionics College]].

### Scivias of the Pretender

The scivias of the Pretender were seemingly prophetic visions experienced from early childhood through to their [[Fall of the Pretender|fall]]. The scivias are thought how to have been moments of particular closeness to the [[Psionic Sphere]] and its various realms, but there is no way of confirming these hypotheses after the fact.

After the [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revelation]] of the [[Pretender]] to the rest of humanity, the scivias were keenly transcribed and spoken of by their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]], though many of these materials were lost with their fall far from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. The most famous of these visions inspired the [[Questing Charter]] and the religious pilgrimage into the [[Deep Deserts]] that followed.

### Psionic awakening

The Pretender displayed a mastery in awakening the [[Psionics#Psionic influence|psionic influence]] of others who had never before shown any signs of [[Psionics#psionic abilities|psionic ability]]. At first, they would do so consciously and actively, taking time to touch each new [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciple]], but by the time they left [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] on their [[Questing Charter of the Pretender|religious pilgrimage]] their fleeting presence alone was often enough to awaken those around them.

It is even said that the origin of [[Gljiva, the Conquering Fungus]] is tied to the Pretender, who granted not only psionic influence but consciousness itself to a growth of mundane mushrooms [[Scenes from the Life of the Pretender IV|along their march]] to the [[Deep Deserts]]. Whether this account, in actuality, holds any weight is unknown.
