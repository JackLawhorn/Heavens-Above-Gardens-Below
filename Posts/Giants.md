The oldest of the [[Minor Aspects]] and direct descendants of the [[Mundial Aspects]] known as the [[Mundial Aspects#motes of the landscapes|motes of the landscapes]], the Giants were intended to be the wardens of the [[Known World]]'s surface and its skies.

## Foundational Giant myth

Two "foundational" Giants were part of the [[Angels]]' divine blueprint for the [[Old World]], taking turns to hold up the sky and keep it in its place above the surface of the world. Shortly after the [[fallen world|fall]] – amidst the chaos of the [[Wild Magics]] and their [[nyxfire]] storms – a third was born as their son: Aker, Aspect of the Horizon.

As the [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]] now known as the [[Lunar Aspects#<strike>The Fallen Son</strike>|Fallen Son]] came to commit his [[paradoxy]] against the order of the Angels, the foundational Giants themselves struck at his lunar form with their great blades of stone, sending him crashing down into the [[Sink]] and creating opportunity for their son Aker to wrest control of the sky from them.

## Empire of Dyēus

Having stolen the domains of the surface and the sky from his forebearers – the [[#foundational giant myth|foundational giants]] – Aker, Aspect of the Horizon and his many thousands of children founded the Empire of Dyēus. From the clouds themselves, they forged hundreds of citadels and hung them in the sky. From the waters of the [[Sink]] – into which the [[Lunar Aspects#<strike>The Fallen Son</strike>|Fallen Son]] plunged and enabled Aker's great victory – they plucked a brilliant blue that would become the color of the sky itself.

The Giants of Dyēus are a warlike people, and their citadels fought against each other for the untold millennia of the [[fallen world|fall]]. They fought over titles and territory and petty squabbles. They lived for centuries, each of them, and that time was spent expanding their citadels and stabbing the backs of their neighbors. The [[Valley of Ruins]] are littered with the remnants of these conflicts, gargantuan arms plunged deep into the earth after falling from above.

So great was the scope of this Empire that its massive blue citadels span the breadth of this domain in its entirety, lending it its blue color during the day. And so great was the might of the Giants of the Empire that the [[Angels]] themselves dispatched the [[Storm Elves]] and their fleets of [[cloudcraft]] to eliminate the threat to their divine plans for the [[Known World]].
