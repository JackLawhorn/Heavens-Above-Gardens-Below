> The "Elven March" might also refer to the facet of the [[Organic magics of the Elven Legion]]. The use of this term to describe the early majority of the [[Heliotropic Age]] is nearly as old as this period itself, but was formally adopted by [[House of the Sun]] historians during [[Reconstruction]].

Stretching from the [[nyxfall of the Elven Legion]] through to the [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founding]] of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the Elven March period comprised the vast majority of the [[Heliotropic Age]]. It is characterized by the clans of early humanity following the Legion from the [[Valley of Ruins]] in the North to the [[Sun Coast]], and by the empowering of the humans through the gathering of magics of their own.

The duration of this period is difficult to ascertain after the destruction of the [[Burning]] that ended the [[Red Death]] period, but it is estimated by human historians to have lasted between 800 and 1200 years.
