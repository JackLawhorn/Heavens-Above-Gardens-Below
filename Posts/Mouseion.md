The Mouseion is the mecca of the arts in the [[Known World]]. Inspired by the bardistry of the [[Elven Legion|Elven]] [[Griot|Griots]], humanity's artists create and perform and present here, their works spilling out into the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s many streets and squares and gardens. Many of the [[Great Works]] were created by its members under commission by the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]].

## History of the Mouseion

> For more, see [[History of the Subjective]].

The Mouseion was formed as a constellation of humanity's greatest bards and artists  upon the [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founding]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] in the [[Later Heliotropic Age]]. Greatly inspired by the [[Griot|Griots]] of the [[Sun Elves]], they sought knowledge and understanding and betterment of the human race through what [[Scholars of the City|scholars]] would come to call [[the Subjective]]. They, along with the early [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivist scholars]] of the [[Materialists College]], founded the City's [[Scholars Quarter]].

The losses of the [[Crisis of Hubris]] had great impact on the arts and the rising prominence of the Mouseion. The losses of the [[Burning]] that ended the [[Red Death period]] famously included the vast majority of human art and other historical artifacts, and [[Reconstruction]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] saw a massive counter-reaction to that loss. Art of all kinds flooded outward from the halls of the Mouseion itself and into the streets and onto the walls of the City.

Then, throughout the [[Renascence]], a great deal of technical improvement was seen in the arts and what is now called [[History of the Subjective#Renascence Objectivism|Renascence Objectivism]]. Such advancements created a shift in the place of art in the City. Portraiture in particular put art in the home and made a luxury out of it. Renascence art now lines the halls of the [[Court]] and the offices of the [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]]

### The Mouseion and the Philosophers Guild

In [[Early Crisis of Hubris]], the first great fracturing of the [[Scholars of the City#subjectivists|subjectivist scholars]] occurred. It was the lecturers and politicians – [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]], their advisors, even a number of [[Orator|Orators]] – who broke off from the Mouseion citing "intellectual differences". This splinter formed the [[Philosophers Guild]] whose studios were lecture halls and whose audience was the very streets and [[rayas]] of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]. The artists and bards of the Mouseion have always held a contentious relationship with the [[Guild]] and its own splinter the [[First Vergonic Church]].

## Access to the arts in the City

The home of the arts in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] – and indeed all of the [[Known World]] – is the Mouseion in the [[Scholars Quarter]]. Its halls are constantly home to visiting art shows and both permanent and rotating exhibits. Its lecture halls are commanded by the booming voices of the brightest minds, sometimes many in heated debate. Its stages have bore witness to the greatest of tragic and comedic performances and presentations. These are public places, entirely open to the populace of the City free of charge. As far back as the [[Later Heliotropic Age]] it was an expected part of life and a responsibility of citizenry to go out and experience the arts just as skills, trades, and professions would be pursued.

And art is unavoidable out in the City as well. [[Monuments]] populate the squares and [[Gardens of the City|gardens]], and the towers and [[roccas]] that make up the skyline are monuments themselves to [[Ylem]] or to various patron [[Aspect|Aspects]]. Art adorns the [[walls]] and the [[rayas]], and is created, composed, and performed anywhere an audience might constellate. As of the [[Renascence]], art is also commissioned by the elite and the high-class so that it can be found in the home and in other private places.
