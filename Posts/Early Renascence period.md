The Early Renascence period is defined beginning immediately following the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of the [[Silver Wolves]] which ended the [[Crisis of Hubris]]. The devastating awakening of the [[Dreaming psions]] and their [[Exile of the Dreaming psions|exile]] is a generally agreed upon demarcation between the Early and [[Later Renascence period|Later Renascence]].

## Rise of the Psionics College

Out of the ashes of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] rose the [[Psionics College]] whose scholars took an [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist]] approach to the field of [[psionics]] rather than embracing their predecessors' [[mystic psionics|mystic practices]]. Through this new lens, psionics took shape not as a [[Magics in the Known World|field of magics]] but as a field of science that might be explored as any other.

Throughout the [[Renascence]], the [[College]] grew to be one of the greatest and most influential [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]].

## Persecution of cland peoples

> For more, see [[Decline of cland culture]].

The losses of the [[Red Death period]] had largely moved humanity within [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] away from [[cland]] culture and towards a society in which identity was largely defined by one's patron [[House]]. After [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of the [[Silver Wolves]], all of the City turned against [[Clan Wolfstepper]] for the sins of the [[New Silver Age]], and this ire quickly turned towards other peoples who still clung to the old ways of the [[human clans]].

Many of the peoples who faced this persecution would go on to form the [[Wayfarers Guild]], a political entity behind which they were able to mask their surviving cland traditions.

## The human diaspora

For the first time in human history, [[Quest|quests]] outside of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] yielded successful ventures far from their people's home and the safety of the [[Elven Signaltower]]. By the end of the [[Renascence]], the City would have expanded across the wider [[Known World]] with [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] founded by a [[Union]] of [[Questing Houses]].

And it was not just the favored Questing Houses of the [[Court]]. This was a strange age – coming off of the monumental losses of the [[Crisis of Hubris]] – and a number of human peoples who found themselves facing persecution. Both [[House Talos]] and the [[Wayfarers Guild]] founded prominent colonies that today are shining jewels of the [[Republic]].
