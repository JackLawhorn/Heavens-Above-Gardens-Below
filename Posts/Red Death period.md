This period is, of course, most infamous for the [[Red Death]] after which it is named: a deadly and infectious plague spread by the [[Red Court]], [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] of Hunger. Originally brought across the [[Great Sea]] to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] by the ships of the [[Shipwrights Guild]], this plague – and the horrific beasts its victims were warped – into besieged the City for over eight months before being brought to an end by a great [[Burning]].

## New magics and dark curiosity

The Red Death period saw significant advancements in the field of [[materialist magics]], despite the great shame of the [[Materialists College]] being unable to find a true solution to the problem of the [[Red Death]] or a weakness of the soldiers of the [[Red Court]]. The College scholars sought answers in the City's corpses, giving rise to the first ranks of the anatomists. And in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] to come, the anatomists would give way to the infamous [[necromancer demons]] whose works would lead to the [[fall of the Materialists College]].

On [[the night of the Burning]], a materialist scholar would just barely manage to rescue a young child from the destruction and devastation to come. In the first years of the Later Crisis of Hubris, the child would be revealed to possess an entirely new class of magics: what would come to be known as [[psionics]]. Though this first psion would later be revealed as simply a [[Pretender]], the scholars they inspired would go on to found the incredibly influential [[Psionics College]].

Later, with the discovery of [[animalcules]] within the human anatomy in the [[Early Renascence period]], the studies and experiments of the anatomists would give way to the development of humanity's first [[Hexecraft pacts]] by the [[witch clans]]. This development would also take great inspiration from the Red Court's own hexecraft pacts.

## The destruction and rebirth of human history

The great [[Burning]], which ultimately brought this period to its end, destroyed over one third of the [[Old City]]: what is now known as the [[Red Quarter]]. Along with the last of the [[Red Court]]'s soldiers and infect, the last of humanity's recorded history was incinerated. Though the [[Crisis of Hubris]] was not yet over with the end of the Red Death period, this would go on to usher in a new age of scholarship, discovery, and invention. One centered around the recording of history not only for posterity's sake but for the betterment of humanity and the securing of their future.

In the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], the very same [[House]] responsible for this devastating loss – the [[House of the Sun]] – would rise to prominence as leaders of the [[Court]]. Equal parts punishment for their role in the Burning and reward for ending the [[Red Death]], each new [[Great House]] to [[Fallen Houses|fall]] would put the House of the Sun and its [[Orator]] closer to unrivaled power and the ability to enact real change in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].
