> For more on the forming of this [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]] with their patron [[Aspect]] the [[Lunar Aspects#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]], see the [[birth of the Silver Wolves]].

## Magics and extramundane abilities

The [[Silver Wolves]] of [[Clan Wolfstepper]] gained great power upon forging their [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]] with the [[Lunar Aspects#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]], the first of humanity to rise above their station and claim magics of their own.

Though the true nature of this experience would not be understood by outsiders for centuries – until their [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] – they returned noticeably different, their nature more wolf-like in many ways. Their behavior and social interactions changed significantly, aligning more closely with those of a pack of wolves. They gained extra-mundane senses of smell and hearing as well, making them even more proficient hunters and watchers.

### Wolf form

Most prominent of course was their ability to take the physical form of a wolf. As they described it, their spirit, their [[aura]] is shared between two forms, but shifting between these distinct anatomies was as natural to them as as walking. This transformation is instantaneous, without any process of taking on in-between states.

This made them proficient at navigating many different environments, quickly alternating between bipedal and quadrupedal forms to move over, under, and around obstacles. The unpredictable nature of this transformation also allowed them to outmaneuver enemies in both ranged and close-quarters combat, as well as granting them access to deadly, tearing teeth and claws.

## The Wolf Mother

A powerful [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]] sitting above the [[Known World]], the [[Lunar Aspects#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]] is a powerful [[Iconic pacts|patron]] and ally to the [[Silver Wolves]]. She sees all under the night sky through her great eye – the [[silver moon]] – and relays crucial reconnaissance to her children, though typically in the form of cryptic warnings and vague prophecy. Any of her pack may summon her counsel, though she may only appear at night and far from the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] and the rest of humanity.

### Silver

Silver has always been kept by [[Clan Wolfstepper]]. The [[docetic materials|docetic material]] is not only a part of the [[silver moon|lunar form]] of the [[Wolf Mother]] herself but also a powerful resource. Beyond its [[Silver#Practical applications of silver|many practical applications]], the children of Clan Wolfstepper produce an interesting reaction from the metal. Their blades are sharper and their armor lighter and more durable, both made of silver and sometimes even pure silver. Their robes are sewn with silver threads, their jewelry pure silver to a one.

Most curiously, such equipment and adornments seamlessly transform to align with their human or wolf form. The efforts of the [[Fall of the Materialists College|since-fallen]] [[Materialists College]] proved fruitless in understanding the mechanics of these magics.
