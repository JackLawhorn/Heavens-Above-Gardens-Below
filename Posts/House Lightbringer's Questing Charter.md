Inspired by their clan's mentors the [[Sun Elves]] and feeling claustrophobic within the walls of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], [[House Lightbringer]] stands before the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]] seeking a [[Questing Charter]] for a new [[quest]] of their own.

## The quest

Their quest was simple: follow the path of the [[Elven Legion]]'s [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March]], east along the [[Sun Coast]], rounding the coastline of the [[Great Sea]], and eventually continuing down into the [[lands to the south]].

The first leg of this journey was to be the trek from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] to the eastern coast of the Great Sea. Once rounded, that would be a suitable place to signal for their people. Already, a burgeoning [[Shipwrights Guild]], armed with hidden knowledge eked out of the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#water motes|water motes]], were hard at work on vessels that would allow them to march across the [[Sink]] itself.

Once a successful rendezvous was made, supplies and discoveries and even the ranks of the [[#questing party]] could be exchanged. A base camp would be made and humanity's first settlement outside of the City of Gardens would be founded there. And just like that, victory against the treacherous threats of the [[Known World]] would be theirs.

### The questing party

As part of their [[Questing Charter]], [[House Lightbringer]] received funding from the [[Court]] with which they bought the aid of a number of other [[House|Houses]], including representatives from the other [[Great House|Great Houses]].

From the [[Oremongers Guild]], they were granted a dozen [[Oremongers Guild#artificer knights|artificer knights]], two dozen [[armiger]] squires, and three dozen [[sol|solas]] of their steel. The strongest fighting force in the [[Known World]] then or since, these assets would surely allow the [[quest|questing party]] to survive humanity's first perilous trek outside of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] without the protection of the [[Sun Elves]].

From the [[Clan Wolfstepper]], they were granted four packs of six [[Silver Wolves]]. Humanities greatest hunters, these packs would provide food along the journey. Their connection to the [[Lunar Aspects]] and observation under her great silver eye up in the [[Nyx]] would also allow them to foresee threats and even enable limited communicate with their people back in the City. 

Mage scholars from the [[Materialists College]], enticed by the promise of countless discoveries out in the wider world, joined the questing party in the dozens. Though most of their ranks were populated by younger [[Materialist magics|materialists]] eager to prove their metal and bring home treasures and knowledge all their own, they did come equipped with powerful trinkets and bobbles that might prove valuable in any number of scenarios.

From the other Houses of the Court came a number of interested parties, including a wave of [[Rookish clans|Rookish]] [[Rookish clans#Raptors|Raptors]] and a gang of [[Agisters Guild#stag knights|stag knights]] from the [[Agisters Guild]], both of which hold a close connection to the forests of the Known World.

## Reception

Of course, [[House Lightbringer]] saw significant support for their [[Questing Charter]] from the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]]. As a [[Great House]] themselves, they wielded immense political power. And, as one of the great [[human clans|clans]] of the [[Elven March|Elven March period]], they also possessed the ability to persuade and inspire their peoples to action as they saw fit. In truth, no living human had a true understanding of the hardships of the March, only the stories and myths passed down from generation to generation since.

Bearing more than a superficial resemblance to the [[Sun Elves]] themselves, some standing near three strides tall, they had done well in filling the gap left behind by their mentors in the hearts of their people. It was understood and even expected that if anyone would lead humanity into a bright future, it would be House Lightbringer. This was, after all, purported to be humanity's [[First Golden Age]]. They had conquered their small corner of the [[Known World]], developed under the mentorship of [[Ylem]]'s chosen children the Sun Elves] Was this not the most logical next leap to take?

### Detractors

But not every [[House]] gave their support for this endeavor, because they never did. What of the rest of them sat here in the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]? Humanity would not only lose a protector, but also a [[Great House]] and caring leaders under whose watch they had flourished in the [[Later Heliotropic Age]]. What of the resources sent with them for this journey? Could the City spare a dozen [[Oremongers Guild#artificer knights|artificer knights]]? Could they spare hunters and scholars and?

These voices lost out in the end, but would not be forgotten in the years and centuries to come.

## The House of the Sun

The vast majority of the ranks of [[House Lightbringer]], who adopted the chivalric code and nomadic nature of their mentors along the [[Elven March]]: the [[Sun Elves]]. Although it had been centuries since their last long-term journey outside the walls of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], their ranks were so drawn to this [[quest]] that few chose to stay behind. Those who did continued to keep the nyxfire flame of the [[Elven Signaltower]]. Despite this divine charge and their start as a [[Great House]] of the [[Court]], would spend generations as a relatively inconsequential political entity.
