Continuing up on previous thought exercises on [[(Theme) foundational mythology|foundational mythology]] and [[(theme) the elements|the elements]], I find myself thinking of philosophy in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Not only human philosophy but also that of the [[Elven Legion|Elves]] who both possess a streamlined form of thinking and language and hold absolutely true knowledge of the natural of the greater universe known as the [[Nyx]].

In this setting, [[Ylem]] is an inherent, atomic component to both matter and energy, present to a certain extent in all things. Not only that, but it can also be understood as a sentient entity, at once a single lifeform and an entire community or society with laws and hierarchy.

How can we extrapolate from there? What implications exist within that idea and what connections can we draw to real world philosophy and other ways of thinking about our reality?

## Overview

We start this thought exercise by defining labels. If anyone in the [[Known World]] might hold some philosophical understanding of these concepts it would be the [[Elven Legion]]. Fortunately for us, [[Elven tongue|their language]] is so streamlined by way of their divine evolution at the handles of the [[Angels]] that we can count on them to have easily understood interpretations.

This is from where we get the ideas of legion and the monad. **Legion**, also used to refer to a group of Elves itself, describes the whole or at least _a_ whole. **Monad**, a word we can pull from the Greek language and which is the centerpiece of its own real world school of philosophy, describes a singular component of that whole.

Legion and monad can be used to refer to a crowd versus an individual or a universe versus a galaxy. This mimics the often fractal structure that reality takes, and makes them extremely flexible terms for our purposes. Because of this and perhaps most importantly, they hold very little meaning by themselves, instead deriving meaning by their own coupling.

## A fractal reality

Our own reality is hierarchies within hierarchies, from the macroscopic scale of the universe to the endlessly microscopic level of our smallest subatomic particles. The [[Nyx]] as it is understood by humanity in the [[Known World]] replicates this structure with only a few aesthetic tweaks, but additional hierarchies and ways of understanding this reality exist as well. The [[Standard Elven Cosmology]] describes "spheres" beyond the perceivable [[Prime Material Sphere]], and reality as sets and subsets and their overlaps or lack there of.

Within such a complex system, equally infinite in scope to our own, how can we understand our place within it? How can we ascribe significance to things and ideas within such a system, especially as the entirety of our lives and the consequences thereof pale so completely in comparison?

Well, the monad _does_ have meaning within this way of thinking, not only meaning but true, objective meaning. The divine source called [[Ylem]] is present in all things, no matter how small (we can be sure of this because of the dualistic nature of the Nyx: everything that is not Ylem is the [[Dragon]], and every that is the Dragon does not and can not exist). More than that, the Nyx means nothing without these individual components. The monad and the legion continue to give any and all significance to each other, having none themselves.

This fractalizes as far down in scope as we can imagine. Later, I am excited to introduce [[Hexecraft pacts|hexecraft]] as the final category of magic. Hexecraft works by forming [[Pact magics|pacts]] with single-cell organisms called [[animalcules]] that exist within the mage's body. This reverses the pact-bound relationship of a patron aspect to an [[Iconic pacts|iconic]] mage, and ties them together conceptually as well as mechanically.

## Individualism versus community

Relatively far down in scope, at least in comparison to the greater cosmological workings of the [[Nyx]], we find the [[Known World]] and humanity within [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. It is philosophically necessary to extend these concepts into the social sphere, to describe the interactions between people, factions, industries, cultures, and societies.

I'll go into more detail with human philosophy when we reach the [[Renascence]] that came after the disastrous [[Crisis of Hubris]], but essentially the concept of the cosmological/celestial spheres within the [[Standard Elven Cosmology]] are extended into the study of social mechanics as well. The primary social spheres describe politics, knowledge, industry, worship, and the [[Social Spheres Theory#Sphere of the Subjective|Sphere of the Subjective]] (a catch-all for art, philosophy, and related concepts). These combine into secondary social spheres like the secondary colors to describe espionage, commerce, communication, law and justice, [[cosmography]], the great works, propaganda, philosophy, art, and the realm of sports and contest.

## Inspiration

- [Monad (philosophy)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(philosophy)>)
  - Begets the [Dyad](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(philosophy)>) of Ylem and the Dragon, although it is important to think of this like 1s and 0s in [binary](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(philosophy)>) rather than like a 1 and a 2.
- [Monism](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Monad.svg/357px-Monad.svg.png)
  - [Dr. Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Watchmen_characters#Doctor_Manhattan) from [Watchmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Watchmen_characters) actually operates very similarly to Ylem (or maybe more accurately like the Angels), and his trademark symbol which is supposed to represent the hydrogen atom is also a reference to the much older concept of the monad ([source](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Monad.svg/357px-Monad.svg.png)).
- [_Monadology_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology) is a foundational work of philosophical monism, with a greater focus on the metaphysics of god and divinity.

> [!IMPORTANT] Important to note:
> The idea of monad is traditional indivisible, where in this use case it is fractal in nature. Monad and legion are essentially one and the same, with every component of every whole also existing as a whole in and of itself with its own components.
