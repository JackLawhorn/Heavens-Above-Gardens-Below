The Argent Ghetto was built in the [[Red Quarter]] in the [[Early Renascence period]] for the sequestering of the now-disgraced [[Clan Wolfstepper]] after the [[fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of the [[Silver Wolves]]. Within its walls, the Clan are under watchful scrutiny by the agents of the [[Jurisweard]] and curse the [[New Silver Age]] for unleashing this persecution upon them.

## Law in the Argent Ghetto

[[Clan Wolfstepper]] within the Argent Ghetto are under the watchful eye of the [[Jurisweard]], and have few freedoms afforded to them. They are not permitted to leave its walls without escort or a working license. Those without such a license are limited to employment within their own community.

Inversely, the law of the [[Court]] and its Jurisweard is also limited within Argent Ghetto. Lack of rapport with the community makes it difficult for even the [[Bloodhounds]] who grew up there to enforce the rule of law. As a result, community leaders like the [[#cland silversmiths]] take charge and are most often the ones pursuing justice in all but the most extreme cases.

## Silver in the Argent Ghetto

Many among [[Clan Wolfstepper]] within the Argent Ghetto believe that the [[Silver Wolves]] and their sins were directly responsible for the silence of the [[Wolf Mother]] and that – by retrieving as much of the lost [[silver]] as possible – she and her influence might still return one day. Following the [[Crisis of Hubris]], the [[Docetic materials|docetic material]] has been divided by a petty and spiteful humanity and make into useless bobbles, jewelry, and of course the [[Currencies of the City#Silver|silver coins, hastas, and crescents]].

These items are either collected and donated by neighbors or – as is more common – sold for a profit by desperate [[#Beggars of Clan Wolfstepper|beggars]] is forged into trinkets, weapons, and all manner of items that adorn basement shrines to the [[Iconic pacts|patron]] [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]]. Such activities were among the freedoms stripped from the [[Human clans|clan]] after the [[fall of the Silver Wolves]], and these treasures are occasionally raided by the [[Jurisweard]] and their [[Bloodhounds]].

## Classes of Clan Wolfstepper

### Beggars of Clan Wolfstepper

To the rest of the populace of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the name [[Clan Wolfstepper]] conjures first the treacherous [[Silver Wolves]] and second the many beggars who line the outermost borders of the Argent Ghetto. A nuisance more than anything, these unfortunates take home scant amounts of [[silver]] – mostly in the form of the [[Currencies of the City#silver|silver coins, hastas, and crescents]] that bolster the currencies of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

To some, the belief in the return of the [[Wolf Mother]] is motive enough to donate these collections to the [[#Cland silversmiths|community silversmiths]]. To most, the returns from instead selling the materials for a profit help to survive without a working license.

### Cland silversmiths

The [[cland]] silversmiths of the Argent Ghetto do their part to restore the [[Wolf Mother#Docetic forms|docetic form]] of the [[Wolf Mother]] in secret. Their basement shrines to their people's [[Iconic pacts|patron]] [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]] are attended both in small groups and in larger services.

The silversmiths are community leaders as well as leaders of worship in the Argent Ghetto. They are under constant threat from the raids of the [[Jurisweard]] and their [[Bloodhounds]], and work to maintain relationships with the few still-sympathetic factions in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] – namely the [[Rookish clans]].

### Jurisweard Bloodhounds

> For more, see [[Bloodhounds]].

The [[Bloodhounds]] are children of [[Clan Wolfstepper]] selected by the [[Jurisweard]] and elevated out of their shameful station in the Argent Ghetto. Only a handful are selected each generation, and those honored in this way enjoy freedoms that otherwise have been entirely stripped away from others of their [[human clans|clan]]. The Bloodhounds are able to leave the ghetto without supervision and are often brought to attend convenings of the [[Court]].

Throughout the [[Renascence]], they have played key roles in both the [[Vergonic War]] and in the Jurisweard's campaigns against the [[Rookish clans#Rookish Cloaks|Rookish Cloaks]]. In the [[Later Renascence period]], their sense of spite towards their treacherous brethren in the [[New Silver Age]] was taken advantage of to hunt down these highly prioritized threats to the [[Republic]].
