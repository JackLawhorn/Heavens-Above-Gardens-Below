With historical artifacts from before the [[Red Death period]] largely non-existent, humanity does not use a standardized system for tracking the current year. Rather, history is segmented into defined ages and sub-periods that comprise them.

You can expect the historical documents presented here to make use of one or more of the following labels:

- [[Prehistory]]
- [[Heliotropic Age]]
	- [[Elven March|Elven March period]]
	- [[Later Heliotropic Age]]
- [[Crisis of Hubris]]
	- [[Early Crisis of Hubris]]
	- [[Red Death period]]
	- [[Later Crisis of Hubris]]
- [[Renascence]]
	- [[Early Renascence period]]
	- [[Later Renascence period]]
- [[Post-Enlightenment Era]]
	- [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]]
