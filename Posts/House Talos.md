House Talos is a prominent [[House]] of the [[Court]] which arose in the [[Later Renascence period]]. They are a founding member of the [[Engineers Union]] and the settlers of one of the first colonies founded on the [[Isles of the Great Sea|isles]] of the [[Great Sea]]. They are best known the inventors and manufacturers of the [[near-life]] machines called [[simulacra]], which have become commonplace throughout [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and across the [[Republic]].

## History of House Talos

### Origins in the Vergonic Movements

The founder of [[House Talos]] was a sculptor of the [[Mouseion]]. At a meeting of the [[First Vergonic Church]], they met a fellow member from the [[Horologists Guild]] – a [[Houses of Industry|House of Industry]] founded in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and so old that they had seen a great decline in prominence despite the ubiquity of their timekeepers in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. True to the [[Politics of the Scholars Quarter#The Vergonic Movements|Vergonic Movement]], they entered into a lively discussion on the clockwork mechanisms that powered their new companion's work.

Later in their life, when the first sparks of the [[Vergonic War]] were ignited and aspersions were starting to be cast on remnants of the First Vergonic Church, the founder would call on favors and allegiances to flee the City. They would go on to found the [[Isle of Talos]], one of the first colonies settled on the [[Isles of the Great Sea|isles]] of the [[Great Sea]].

### Invention and development of simulacra

Once settled on the [[Isle of Talos]], the founder – remembering a companion he had met in the [[First Vergonic Church]] – began to experiment with sculptures with hidden clockwork mechanisms that allowed them to be animated. Surprisingly, one of these prototypes briefly manifesting attributes of [[near-life]] before laying still once more. Over the next centuries, the founder and their descendants would continue to develop these prototypes: what they called [[simulacra]] of life.

This achievement was long kept secret until the House's remote island colony was populated by whole cultures of simulacra. This technology would of course be shared with the rest of humanity, but first spread throughout the [[colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] of the [[Questing Houses]] in an attempt by the [[Engineers Union]] to cultivate political power and relative independence from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Court]]. Now they are a common sight throughout the streets and [[rayas]] of the City, in every major [[House]], and in the homes of their [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]].

### Houseship and the Engineers Union

It wasn't until the [[Later Renascence period]] when the [[Isle of Talos]] joined the [[Engineers Union]] and revealed themselves to those in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Court]] that they would pursue and be granted [[House|Houseship]]. The value of their [[simulacra]] was apparent to the other Houses and to the [[Orator]] herself, even without the backing of the newly founded [[Engineers Union]]. If the City wished to take advantage of this new miracle of science which had already proliferated among the many [[Questing Houses]] and their [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]].

## The Isle of Melos

> For more, see [[Isle of Melos]].

The members and leadership of House Talos are seldom seen outside of their [[Isle of Melos]]. First settled as a safe haven for its founders in the midst of the [[Vergonic War]], it was one of the first [[Isles of the Great Sea|isles]] of the [[Great Sea]] to be settled by humanity. Today, it is said that its gardens are populated by entire cultures of the [[simulacra]] for which the [[House]] is best known.

## The simulacra of House Talos

> For more, see [[Simulacra]].

The [[simulacra]] of House Talos are a race of [[near-life]] machines that mimic the generation and flow of [[albedo]] throughout the anatomy of living creatures. These great [[Great Works|Scientific Works]] are perhaps the grandest accomplishment of [[Renascence]] humanity, and allowed the House to rise to great prominence in the [[Court]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and in the wider [[Republic]] to come.

## The Engineers Union

> For more, see [[Engineers Union]].

House Talos is represented as a member of the [[Engineers Union]] which grew out of the [[Houses of Industry]] and became a driving force of technological advancement in the [[Later Renascence period]]. It is said that a representative of the [[Blackpowder Guild]] itself arrived on the [[Isle of Talos]] to persuade its [[House|Houseless]] founders to join their [[Union]].
