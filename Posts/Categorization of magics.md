> This note is focused on the components of magics and the criteria by which they are classified. For a list of the recognized fields of magics, see [[Magics in the Known World]].

The categorization and classification of the magics have always been a hot topic for humanity's [[Scholars of the City#objectivists|objectivist scholars]], especially the [[Materialists College]] before [[Fall of the Materialists College|its fall]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]].

## Components of magic

The scholars of [[Later Heliotropic Age]] humanity and their [[Materialists College]] defined what the [[Sun Elves]] called the [[Magics in the Known World|magics]] as having three necessary components: [[#source]], [[#channel]], and [[#intent]].

### Source

A mage's source is the well of power from which [[albedo]] is pulled, and can be either internal or external. For those peoples with [[organic magics]], one's own [[aura]] functions as the source. Others, who instead use [[pact magics]] instead draw albedo from their pact-bound. Others still use artifacts like [[Materialist magics|materialist]] trinkets, including [[docetic materials]], and draw from the albedo imbued within them.

### Channel

A channel is the mechanism through which power flows from the [[#source]] and is directed by a mage. The channel differs greatly even within each [[Magics in the Known World|category and field of magics]]. Some magics are cast from the fingertips or another body part of the mage. Others are channeled through wands, staffs, or some other equipment. In the case of [[Materialist magics|materialist]] trinkets, this equipment often serves as both source and channel.

### Intent

Assured intent on the part of the mage is what draws power from the [[#source]] and through the [[#channel]]. Intent varies from mage to mage based on both natural ability and experience with the magics themselves, and mastering intent in your specific [[Magics in the Known World|field of magics]] is often a life-long journey.

The purposeful nature of intent means magics are rarely used either unconsciously or subconsciously without the use of certain [[Highly Controlled Substances (HCSs)]] such as [[psychedelia]]. One major exception is the field of [[Hexecraft pacts|hexecraft]] which can bypass intent by forming [[Pact magics|pacts]] instead with the [[animalcules]] within one's body rather than with the individual.

## Prominent controversies

### Combat Arts

The [[Combat Arts]] of the [[Sun Elves]] were initially thought by the [[human clans]] to be a form of [[organic magics]] in and of themselves, but were found to be learnable even by humanity along the [[Elven March]].

### Psionics

With the [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revelation]] of the [[Pretender]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], [[psionics]] was believed to be a field of magics in and of itself. Though the [[mystic psionics]] of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] served to usher in the [[Psionic Age]] and ultimately gave rise to the [[Psionics College]], this understanding was found to be flawed by the [[Scholars of the City#objectivists|objectivist scholars]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] who studied it instead as a natural science.
