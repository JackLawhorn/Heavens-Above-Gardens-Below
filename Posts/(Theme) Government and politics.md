## Form of government

[[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] has been a [unitary state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state) for the vast majority of its history, existing as a single, expansive [city-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state). In the late [[Renascence|Renascence period]] and into the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], it has begun expanding into new territories through the granting of [[Questing Charter|Questing Charters]] to [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]] interested in founding their own settlements. This is a form of [chartered company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_company) structure.

The City itself and its Court is a [meritocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy), in which entities which control industry or otherwise produce goods and services also become political entities called "Houses" and whose leaders become [[Lord Representative]] of the Court. It is also a [kritarchy or dikastocratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kritarchy) form of government, meaning that power lies with judges called [[Orator|Orators]] who preside over matters of the Court.

This power ideology, that of the institution known as the Court, is best understood as a [parliamentary republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic). Outside of direct matters of the Court, the government of the City is [minarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minarchism), a night-watchman state whose functions still depend on [libertarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism) theory leftover from the [[Elven March|Elven March period]].

As of the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], the House of the Sun is both the last remaining [[Great House]] of the Court and serves as steward of the City's [state religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion). Divergent ways of worship also have power as political entities through a [[Union]] of Houses called the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]]. The House of the Sun and its Orator maintain [rule according to a higher law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_according_to_higher_law), albeit only through cooperation of the Canon and other political entities.

## Role of government

The several hundred [[House|Houses]] each possess equal voting power in matters of the [[Court]], and the [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] of each represent the best interests of all who work within the House, those who rely on the House's work, as well as their [[Pact magics|patron]] [[Aspect]] or [[Mutualist pacts|mutualist companions]].

From each of the [[Great House|Great Houses]], an [[Orator]] is chosen to preside over matters of the Court rather than having voting power. This position is the highest individual seat of power in the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] and across the [[Post-Enlightenment Era|Post-Enlightenment]] republic.

Among other roles, the Orators moderate of Court debates, discussions, and negotiations, and select the [[Hand of the Court]] on a case-by-case basis. This Hand of the Court executes upon the rulings of the Houses and the Orator(s). Before the Orator's decision is given, any House may volunteer to indicate interest which the Orator will take into account.

These bodies are generally understood as such: the Houses or at least their Lord Representatives are the voice of the populace, the Orator represents the judgement of the populace, and the Hand of the Court is indeed the hand of the populace itself. This system as a whole function solely to represent the best interests of the populace.

## Political action

I'm especially interested in exploring political action as they take place within and through these systems. The [[House|Houses]] each representing distinct domains of influence, similar to the [[Aspect|Aspects]], makes for interesting interactions between them.

Their goods and services determine their value to the populace but also relative value to each other, serving as effective bargaining chips. Some Houses have raw materials to offer, some have the skills necessary to refine them, and others to sell them. Others still sit at the top of this hierarchy, complex entities who benefit from a complex web of the other Houses and these interconnections.

Especially in the time period and scale of technological advancement we're dealing with, I think it's also prudent to consider the value of Houses with their own warrior classes. It is a treacherous world where humanity is particularly vulnerable, protected only by stone walls and the light of the [[Elven Signaltower]] which dissuades many enemies from even approaching them. Excursions too far outside the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] have been met with doom. Inside the walls of the City, things aren't too different. Medieval society, fantasy or not, is perilous, and sometimes outside threats do come inside, as in the case of the [[Red Plague|Red Plague period]].

In peacetime, much of the action is political, taking place within the halls of the [[Court]]. [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] meet and deal and scheme. Espionage can be a real threat to one's power, and so intelligence gathering and defense of one's own intelligence is made a necessity. What political bodies would come about to specialize in these new fields, and how might possession of [[extramundane]] abilities aid in or deter that action?

In addition to the monetary [[Currencies of the City|currencies]] of this society, this creates a secondary tier of social and political currencies like might, industry, and what I've called politique.
