In a remote edge of what the humans call the [[Nyx]], but in reality is simply the [[Prime Material Sphere]] and one of many. On a pitiful world, a [[fallen world]] no longer pertinent to the divine plans of [[Ylem]] and its [[Angels]]. Outside the walls of its sole city: [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. In the [[mines of the Oremongers Guild|mines]] of one of its many factions, the deepest point in all of the [[Known World]].

_Here, this lowly place, is to be the setting of the beginning of the end of everything. The ultimate defeat of reality itself and victory for the [[Dragon]] that is unreality._

Far down in the [[Mines of the Oremongers Guild#The Maw|pit]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]], so far that the divine light of [[Ylem]] is but a pinprick above, the [[Oremongers Guild#earth shapers|earth shapers]] see to their work. Already, no living thing nor even the [[Aspect|Aspects]] of Ylem themselves have ever ventured so far down and back up again. Built on a crater left by a fallen [[Storm Elves|Storm Elf]] defeated by the [[Giants|Giant]] warriors of the [[Giants#Empire of Dyēus|Empire of Dyēus]], this pit is the greatest work of humanity, even greater than the City of Gardens itself. But unlike the City, its construction is not as worship of Ylem but in service of the Guild's own hubris.

500 storeys beneath the surface of the Known World, the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] have turned stagnant and quiet. At this depth, their voices fade from the consciences of the Guild's [[iconic pacts|iconic mages]] and are replaced by others. Replaced by the whisperings of whatever [[Aspect|Aspects]] govern the dark, low places such as this. Replaced by those who would see this world and the entirety of the Nyx flooded by shadow, but who require hands other than their own to dirty. 500 storeys beneath the surface of the Known World, its end is being orchestrated.

What was a vertical shaft – its perimeter shaped into palatial suites used as living quarters, labs and studies, training facilities for the [[Oremongers Guild#Artificer knights|artificer knights]], and hordes of the unearthed treasures kept for themselves – now veers dramatically off-course. Whether its excavators had intended this or were simply oblivious to their own manipulation may never be known, but rest assured the Guild leaders were not so ignorant.

Moving further down – so far that few in the Guild will ever have seen it – it becomes horizontal, its walls no longer clean and smooth but jagged as if carved by hand. It continues like this some way and, though one's sense of direction is all but lost here, doubtlessly leads towards and under and into the center of the City.

You can feel it. A buzzing on the skin and on the tongue and in the ears. This place is leading you, pulling you towards the heart of the Known World: a piece of the Nyx itself.

For several minutes, there isn't another soul apart from your own, another sound apart from your footsteps. There hasn't been any light to guide your journey for much longer than that. Instead, it's your [[Iconic pact of the Oremongers Guild#Per-medium sensation|per-medium sensation]] that allows you to *feel* where the earth ends and the air – thin down here – begins.

Finally, people. The first you've come across in what feels like an eternity. Like you, they work dutifully in the dark without sharing a word. You do not greet them. You're not sure that you could, that the words would be able to leave your lips. You know, instinctively, that many of them have not seen the light of Ylem in days or more. You've only just noticed that you can't remember that last time you saw it either.

The buzzing is stronger here. You're close. They're close and getting closer.

It doesn't *feel* closed off and claustrophobic here. You can sense the bounds of this tunnel around you and yet it's as if a great open space is just out of reach. Like you're back up on the surface.

You are now among the others, the reverberations of their footsteps coming from no more than a few strides away from you. Their work is noble, you think. The infinity of the Nyx now just strides away; unlimited, unbound. Communication, transportation, energy, power. This was to be the [[First Golden Age]] of humanity, and they will be the ones to usher it in.

One last command by the earth shapers, one last shifting of the earth, and suddenly the air changes. Behind an infinitesimal sliver before you bleeds out such light as to blind you and your companions for a moment. The buzzing grows with the light, near unbearable now.

It's you who recovers from the blinding light first. Before you is the heart of the Known World, the [[polar onyx deposit]] above which the City was founded. A single chunk of infinity, both [[legion]] and the [[monad]]. The others seem frozen in time. It's you who reaches forward. As your outstretched fingers graze the [[Docetic materials#onyx|onyx]], you do not feel its surface or any resistance. Instead what you feel is dread.

First, you notice your per-medium perception is gone. Your connection with the earth is *gone*. You find yourself in the heart of the world drowning in the darkness, lit only by the dim pinpricks of light within the onyx before you. Second, the whispers in the dark have left you. You had forgotten they were in your ears, but now the silence of their absence is deafening. And you begin to panic. What have we done? What have *you* done? Under whose influence have you committed this sin, this [[paradoxy]] against the Nyx itself? Lastly, unbearable pain. Not the searing mental pain of the earth motes invading your conscience, but a tearing, ripping, physical pain.

Finally, reality seems to return to you. Your comrades break their silence, joining you in screams of torturous pain. By the dim light you see on their faces what you can only assume is happening to yourself as well. You are terrified of what you see. It is your last thought as the earth surges towards you.

The disaster is felt and heard and seen throughout Omphalos, the City of Gardens. The tremors – stronger even than those felt upon the falling of the Storm Elf, which some among the populace still remembered – originated directly below then could be felt moving towards the northeast. The sound was horrific, apocalyptic: an eruption of noise from the direction of the Guild's pit, met with screams of seemingly sudden pain up and down the streets and [[rayas]]. And visible not only in the City but across the Known World: day turned to night, the Nyx suddenly visible for what must have been less than a minute. Only this wasn't the night sky of the Known World, which the humans knew well, and it never would be again.

When day returned, just as suddenly as it had left, humanity in the City of Gardens looked upon a massive plume of smoke and dirt and dust as tall as the mines were deep. Indeed, they would find the pit – now known as [[the Maw]] – filled in with packed earth as if the Oremongers Guild had never broken ground there. And the hundreds or thousands who had been there buried for eternity in the heart of the earth.

Far to the east, the [[Oremongers Guild#artificer knights|artificer knights]] and the [[armiger]] squires of [[House Lightbringer]]'s [[quest|questing party]] drop to the ground. Their bodies were broken and mangled, and their screams echoed throughout the forests along the [[Sun Coast]]. The warriors amongst the party's ranks found that their blades – to a one forged by the master smiths of the Oremongers Guild – had lost their edges and gone dull.

Such was the first loss of the [[Crisis of Hubris]].

> The [[Oremongers Guild]] were the strongest of humanity's [[Iconic pacts|iconic mages]], capable of shaping the very earth to their will and building the foundation of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] itself. As the first of the [[Fallen Houses]], their destruction was devastating and tainted the relationship between the humans and the [[Mundial Aspects]] forever. Their fall teaches us that there is a natural order to things and that it is the responsibility of us all to do our part in respecting and upholding that order.
