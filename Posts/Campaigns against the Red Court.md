## Losses

Even among the other losses of the [[Crisis of Hubris]], the [[Red Death period]] say devastated [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its population on an unprecedented scale. Between the initial [[Spread of the Red Death|spread]] of the [[Red Death]], protracted warfare between [[Apotropaics]] and the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]], and the destruction of the great [[Burning]] which brough this threat to an end, an estimated 60% of the human population in the [[Known World]] was lost. The absence of historical evidence makes it difficult to determine, but the population is thought to have been approximately one million souls before the start of the Red Death period.

Of those losses, a great many of the [[human clans]] and [[House|Houses]] were wiped out, including the [[Rookish clans|rookish]] [[Rookish cardinals|cardinals]]. In the [[Reconstruction]] to follow, [[cland]] communities and cultures would largely be abandoned in favor of those built around the shared industries of patron Houses.

The losses of the Burning itself were much greater, with 40% of the [[Old City]] – what is now known as the [[Red Quarter]] – razed to the ground. In their vulnerable state and still without the magics of the recently [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fallen]] [[Oremongers Guild]], the rebuilding process would take decades. Worse, the flames of pure [[nyxfire]] incinerated the last of humanity's remaining historical artifacts.

## Controversy

### Red Death period Duchy of Stilts

The [[Red Death period]] refugees who gathered in survivor camps across the newly founded [[Duchy of Stilts]] suffered through an unprecedented level of criminal activity perpetrated by both individual bad actors and the organized efforts of gangs. Largely unaddressed by leadership who were preoccupied with their campaigns against the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]], the consequences of and grudges over these events continue to influence interactions between the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]] to this day.

The [[Apotropaics#Berserkers of the Red Moon|Berserkers]] of the [[Red Moon]], elite [[Apotropaics]] who hailed from [[Clan Wolfstepper]], were particularly infamous. Running an organized protection racket out of the Stilts, they abused their station and brought shame upon their [[Human clans|clan]]. It was alleged by some in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] that these crimes significantly influenced the public perception of the [[Silver Wolves]] and their departure from the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] that was called their [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]].

### The House of the Sun and the Burning

The many losses of the great [[Burning]] that brought the [[Red Death period]] to an end would be the subject of controversy for years to come. Human leadership and the classes of the [[Apotropaics]] had failed to discover a solution to the problem of the [[Red Death]] and the [[soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] who besieged [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. In this time of need, it was the [[House of the Sun]] and their [[House of the Sun#Daywatch|Daywatch]] who chose to unleash the [[Nyxfire motes]] and point them in the direction of the enemy, razing 40% of the City in the process.

Initial detractors understandably placed the blame for these losses on the shoulders of the House of the Sun. As penance for incinerated a great many historical artifacts, the [[Great House]] took on the role of the City's [[House of the Sun#Lorekeepers|lorekeepers]], but this too saw controversy as a grab for power in the [[Court]] of the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]].
