After a rapid rise as the greatest [[cults|cult]] in the history of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] stand before the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]] seeking a [[Questing Charter]] for a new [[quest]] of their own.

## The quest

The [[Pretender]] had glimpsed an omen on the horizon, a gleaming beacon to the north. There, they said, was a land where the membrane between the [[Psionic Sphere]] and the [[Prime Material Sphere]] was thin. The [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] and their messiah would leave [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and march – as the [[Sun Elves]] and humanity of old had in the [[Elven March|Elven March period]] – into a bright future.

The exact location of this place was unknown, only that it was far to the north-northwest. In the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], the sole record of what lands may exist to the north were those third-hand accounts of the [[Elven codices]]. Still, the Pretender was confident: [[#the questing party|their party]] would retrace the path of the Elven March, following the [[Gold Coast]] to their destination.

### The questing party

The questing party would be entirely made up of the faithful: awakened [[Psion|psions]] marching under the banner of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]]. The [[Pretender]] and their trusted [[Mystic psionics#Psiknight|Psiknights]] would be more than enough to protect the lot, and in truth none of the Disciples would be helpless along the march.

This party was to be a joyous one: [[Mystic psionics#Illusionist|illusionists]] and [[Mystic psionics#Mystic storytelling|mystic storytellers]] and [[Mystic psionics#Dwaalstepper|dwaalsteppers]] maintaining morale day and night. They would be self sustaining. They would tend to their wounded and would honor those who did not arrive at this promised land with them. And all along the way they would better their [[psionics]], discovering new [[psionics#psionic abilities|abilities]] and learning from their messiah.

## Reception

The [[Disciples of the Pretender]] enjoyed significant influence in [[Court]] and their [[Questing Charter]] saw majority support of the [[House|Houses]] even without the sponsorship of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]].

The [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] and the two [[Great House|Great Houses]] – the [[House of the Sun]] and the [[Silver Wolves]] – were the most prominent detractors. For the Canon, it was because of the meteoric rise of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] which at this point was far larger than any other [[Iconic House|heterodoxy]]. For the Silver Wolves, it was because they were distrustful of the [[Pretender]] and their powerful, unfamiliar [[psionics]].

And for the [[Orator]] of the House of the Sun, it was because her adopted child had dared to rebel against her authority. She had welcomed the Pretender into her home, had raised them as her own. And now, they threatened to leave [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] forever.

## Sixth Great House of the Court

As a surprise development in these proceedings, the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] were extended [[Great House|Great Houseship]], named the sixth Great House of the [[Court]]. Though the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] and the other two Great Houses – the [[House of the Sun]] and the [[Silver Wolves]] – were among the most prominent detractors of the [[Pretender]]'s [[Questing Charter]], they seemingly reversed their decision when it became clear that it would receive majority support even without them.

With the naming came the resources necessary for their [[quest]], as well as an insurance that their legacy would carry forward in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] for better or for worse. It is generally understood in the modern day that the support of the former detractors came as a way of ensuring that their potential [[Fallen Houses|fall]] would move forward their own agendas. And sure enough, the Disciples of the Pretender are remembered today as a moral loss just like those of the [[Oremongers Guild]], [[House Lightbringer]], and the [[Materialists College]].
