The [[Silver Wolves]] were the last of the [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the [[Court]] to [[Fallen Houses|fall]] in the [[Crisis of Hubris]]. Their sin was to abandon humanity within [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], and this last great loss of an [[Ages of the Known World|age]] of losses is what brought about the [[Renascence]] that followed.

## Betrayal of the Silver Wolves

Since the night that [[Clan Wolfstepper]] was [[Birth of the Silver Wolves|born]] along the [[Elven March]], the [[Silver Wolves]] had been the keepers of a [[Luminary#Prophesy of the Luminary|prophesy]] that a [[Moon-Touched]] child of the [[Wolf Mother]] herself would be born to humanity. When the [[Red Death period]] was brought to an end and the [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]] was released from the [[extra-physical]] [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Sphere]] of the [[Red Court]], she revealed that the prophesy would be coming to fruition far sooner than expected. Moreover, the child – called the [[Luminary]] – would be born of a son of Clan Wolfstepper and the daughter of the [[House of the Sun]]'s [[Orator]].

For centuries, the Silver Wolves had feared the worst of humanity's reception of the Luminary's coming, and had even buried knowledge of the prophesy over the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]]. And so they resolved to depart from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] in the mid of night and without warning, taking the mother of the child with them. Calling themselves the [[New Silver Age]], they went out into the wider [[Known World]] to await the birth of their savior.

## Consequences of the fall

When the populace of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] awoke the morning after the [[Silver Wolves]] had departed, they had no way of understanding what had happened. They had been a daily sight in the City since its very [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founding]] more than an [[Ages of the Known World|age]] before, but their sudden absence was only recognized initially by those it had affected most: their brethren in [[Clan Wolfstepper]] and the [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] and other agents of the [[Court]] who were accustomed to their guards. And of course the [[House of the Sun]]'s [[Orator]], who had lost not only her political allies but also her daughter.

The reason behind their departure was not be pieced together – through the interrogations of Clan Wolfstepper's elders by agents of the [[Jurisweard]] – until weeks after the Orator declared that the Silver Wolves had [[Fallen Houses|fallen]].

### Persecution of Clan Wolfstepper

With the [[Silver Wolves]] having departed [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[human clans|clan]] from whom they hailed suffered the brunt of the consequences. [[Clan Wolfstepper]] immediately became the target of significant persecution from the rest of humanity and were watched closely by the agents of the [[Jurisweard]]. Many of their freedoms were lost – sometimes gradually but often in leaps – and they were ultimately sequestered to the [[Argent Ghetto]] where they remain to this day.

#### Taking of the silver

Of all the consequences suffered by [[Clan Wolfstepper]] after the fall of the [[Silver Wolves]], the most significant and truthfully the most shameful on the part of humanity is the taking of the [[silver]]. The reserves of the [[Docetic materials|docetic material]] – pieces of the [[Wolf Mother]]'s [[silver moon|lunar form]] itself come crashing down to the [[Known World]] – which the treacherous [[New Silver Age]] had not taken with them were taken from their reserves and desecrated.

Now, silver has been spread throughout [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] as its smallest denomination of [[Currencies of the City|currency]]: the [[Currencies of the City#Silver|silver coins, hastas, and crescents]]. It has been split into smaller and smaller pieces such that the children of the Wolf Mother will never be able recover it.

### Consolidation of the Great Houses

With the fall of the [[Silver Wolves]], the [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the [[Court]] had effectively been consolidated such that only the [[House of the Sun]] and its [[Orator]] remained. The four original Great Houses – the [[Oremongers Guild]], [[House Lightbringer]], the [[Materialists College]], and now the Silver Wolves – had fallen, as had the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] who like the House of the Sun had gained Great Houseship during the [[Crisis of Hubris]].

In the [[Renascence]] that followed, and even now in the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]], the House of the Sun and its Orator would hold significant control over matters of the Court. No other [[House]] has managed to cultivate the support necessary to vie for Great Houseship since.

### Ushering in of the Renascence

The last of the [[Great House|Great Houses]] to [[Fallen Houses|fall]], the betrayal of the [[Silver Wolves]] was perhaps the greatest loss of the [[Crisis of Hubris]] save for the [[Red Death period]] itself. Clan Wolfstepper had been one of the great [[human clans]] of the [[Elven March]], had been named one of the original four Great Houses, and had long been considered the greatest of humanity. They had lost their not only their greatest warriors but also their greatest and longest-standing leaders.

The [[Orator]] of the [[House of the Sun]] – now the sole Great House of the [[Court]] – declared that this loss would be the one to finally bring this [[Ages of the Known World|age]] of loss to an end. And what she said was true. The fall of the Silver Wolves demarks the end of the Crisis of Hubris and the dawn of the [[Renascence]]. In response to the losses of the last age, humanity spent the next arming themselves with knowledge and mostly mundane tools such that they would never again suffer such losses.
