When the [[Elven Legion]] made [[nyxfall]] on this world, humanity was still in its infancy. Hiding in caves and crags, thousands of disparate, disconnected clans had managed to weather untold generations of the raging [[nyxfire]] storms which twisted and warped everything in their path.

First hearing and then seeing that the storms had cleared, these dregs ventured out of their holes for the first time in their lives. Seeing the Elves – beautiful, powerful warriors come down from the [[Nyx]] – and thinking them to be gods, the humans fell down to their knees in worship.

It is said that the [[Sun Elves]] took pity on the remnants of humanity. Perhaps the humans had even been destined to become a Legion themselves, their divine evolution halted by the [[nyxfire]] of the [[Glossary/Wild Magics]] that plagued this [[Fallen world]].

As the [[Storm Elves]] ascended to their [[cloudcraft]] and the battlegrounds above, the High [[Griot]] of the [[Sun Elves]] sought consult from the [[Nyx]]. When their attention returned to this world, they spoke in the tongue of their people and the humans miraculously understood.

"Stand up and be as the [[Orior]]. It is by the grace of [[Ylem]] that we are before you. That our world bore a Legion, that we have withstood travel across the [[Nyx]], and that we have been delivered here. Does that make us gods to worship? Your own world has fallen and yet you have survived. I say stand, stand up closer to the light of [[Ylem]] and join us in reclaiming this world for the kingdom of heaven."

Such was the rise of humanity, the first race of the [[Orior]] on this, the [[Known World]].
