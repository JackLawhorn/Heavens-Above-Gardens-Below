"Warlock" comes from an [[Elven tongue|Old Elven]] word meaning "pact breaker", and is used to refer to those who have broken the terms of primarily [[iconic pacts]].

## Mechanics of broken pacts

Mechanically, the breaking of the terms of a [[Pact magics|pact]] has an impact on the flow of [[albedo]] between your [[aura]] and that of the other [[Pact magics|pact-bound]] party that can be devastating. It has been described by survivors as a "snapping" of the spiritual veins through which the albedo flows. Just as flow of albedo can tangibly alter one's aura or even physical form – as in the case of the [[Silver Wolves]] as well as the [[Rookish clans|rooks]] and their [[Rookish clans#raptor eyes|raptor eyes]] – the sudden reversal or breaking of that flow leaves scars that persist through generations of one's bloodline.

In addition to any [[#physical effects]], warlocks are afflicted by spiritual effects that do not dilute over generations and impact bloodlines in perpetuity. Most prominent is the inability to enter into pacts going forward. So irrevocable was the [[paradoxy]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] that no human may form a pact with the [[Mundial Aspects]] again. In most cases, however, this is limited to the responsible parties. According to the [[History of materialist magics#The Red Death period|anatomists]] of the [[Materialists College]], the continued breaking of pacts and natural mixing of bloodlines may lead to a future where the forming of pacts is impossible for the human race as a whole.

### Physical effects

Warlocks are afflicted with visible and apparent scars of their sin. These scars are etched into one's [[aura]] and are passed down bloodlines, though the physical or visible deformities dilute over the course of generations.

| d8 | Result |
| - | - |
| 1 | Long, winding scars that cover some portion of the body, often including the face. |
| 2 | Loss of hair, either on the head or the entire body. |
| 3 | An unfortunate twisting of the skin and skeleton that human physicians refer to as "Twist Syndrome". |
| 4 | Deformity of one or both eyes, including color changes, splitting of the pupils, or blindness. |
| 5 | Loss of the ability to speak or, more rarely, for your speech to be understood. |
| 6 | Deafness in one or both ears or, more rarely, loss of the ability to understand others. |
| 7 | Paralysis or persistent, uncontrollable movement in one or more extremities. |
| 8 | A splitting of the tongue which marks you not only as a warlock but also as a liar. |

## Role in the City

Almost as a rule, human warlocks are [[Class and caste in the City|social outcasts]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], having broken pacts with their respective [[iconic pacts|patron]] [[Aspect|Aspects]] of the pure divinity of [[Ylem]]. Some fear or hate them purely for religious reasons, others hold superstitious beliefs of contagious sin, and others still despise the visible scars they wear. As a result, the vast majority of the City's warlock population lives in the [[Cumbergrounds]].

The most prominent exception would be the [[The Maw#Undergardeners|Undergardeners]] of [[the Maw]] who have largely avoided persecution through isolation and taking on the responsibility of tending to the [[Gardens of the City|gardens]] that now adorn the site of their [[paradoxy]].
