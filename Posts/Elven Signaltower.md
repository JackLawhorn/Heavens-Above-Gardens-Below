Overseen by [[House Lightbringer]] and the [[House of the Sun]] after them, the Elven Signaltower stands at the heart of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and of the world itself. Built upon a large, [[polar onyx deposit]], it is quite literally the center of the [[Known World]], and its light can be seen in all of the lands visited by humanity.

## Gateway to the Nyx

The Signaltower's greatest purpose is as the [[Known World]]'s gateway to the wider [[Nyx]], its light visible – even as just a speck – in the night sky of countless others.

For nyxfaring peoples [[Nyxfarer|nyxfaring]] like the [[Elven Legion|Elven Legions]] and perhaps even the humans of the future, it serves as a waypoint and a port for their traversal between the worlds. Marching across the Nyx without such a waypoint is a dangerous, often catastrophic endeavor fit only for the Elves themselves.

To the [[Angels]], it is another link in the cosmic chain that binds the [[Dragon]] and a weapon in the eternal conflict known as the [[roiling of the Nyx]].

## Monument to Ylem

In this way, it also functions as a monument to [[Ylem]]. In the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]], it is the centerpiece of all practices of worship.

To the races of the [[Orior]] across the [[Known World]], it is as a beacon calling to them. A great many, individuals and entire peoples alike, have made pilgrimage to the City and its Signaltower.

## Sun of the Known World

The Signaltower is the sun of the [[Known World]], just like those of each of the worlds across the [[Nyx]]. It is said that along the entirety of the [[Elven Legion]]'s [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March|march]] only the icy far south is beyond the reach of its light.

The mechanism that controls its cap can direct the light of its [[nyxfire]] flame, creating a cycle of day and night when properly maintained by its keepers. During the day, the light is to be unrestricted, and its rays are cast across the surface of the world and even into the depths of the [[Sink]]. At night, the light is to be directed upwards towards the Nyx, revealing the infinities of the cosmos.

The light of [[Ylem]] promotes verdancy and growth, more concentrated closer to the Signaltower itself. The plants of the Known World, including the [[Verdant Knights]], feed directly on this light and thrive on it. Their exhalation of oxygen and cool air creates the phenomenon called climate.

## Hub of the City

[[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] itself was built around the Signaltower, what now is called the [[Old City]]. Closest to its base is the [[White Quarter]], which is home to the [[Court]] and later the [[Orator]]'s [[Hall of Public Record]]. Also nearby are the [[Scholars Quarter]] and later the [[Red Quarter]] and the [[Duchy of Stilts]].
