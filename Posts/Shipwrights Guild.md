## History of the Shipwrights Guild

> For more on the history of land, sea, and air transportation, see [[Transportation in the Known World]].

### The Heliotropic Age

The ancestors of what is now the Shipwrights Guild can be traced back to those who formed [[mutualist pacts]] with the horses and stags along the [[Elven March]], and the first [[cland]] engineers who developed simple land vehicles such as carts and wagons that could be pulled by such creatures. Their cland inventors would go on to refine these designs after the founding of[[ Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] in the [[Later Heliotropic Age]] as humankind settled in one place for the first time. Working with the smiths of the [[Oremongers Guild]] and the mounted [[human clans|clans]] and [[House|Houses]] such as the [[Agisters Guild]] and their [[Agisters Guild#stag knights|stag knights]], they invented chariots, coaches, and other land vehicles.

### The Crisis of Hubris

Their descendants would go on to form the [[Shipwrights Guild]] in the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]]. Although they are perhaps best known for their nautical vessels, they have a rich history in all forms of vehicular engineering. They co-founded the [[Duchy of Stilts]] with the [[Fisher Queens]], and had developed humanity's first fleet of seafaring vessels before tragedy struck. In the maiden voyage of their first ship – sent to retrieve the survivors of [[House Lightbringer]] from base of the [[Nyxblight Tree]] on the eastern shore of the [[Great Sea]] – they unwittingly brought the [[Red Court]] and their [[Red Death|plague]] back to the City instead. Still, the Duchy of Stilts played a major role in the survival of humanity in the [[Red Death period]], and so they were largely able to survive the political implications of this tragedy.

In the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], the Guild was able to largely repair their status and standing after playing a key role in early [[Reconstruction]] efforts with their land vehicles able to haul materials and transport workers. Although they would participate in yet another failed [[Quest into Oblivion]] – that of the [[Questing Charter]] granted to the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] – the political sentiment of the time ensured that this would not be held against them either.

### The Renascence period

Instead, they saw tremendous growth into and throughout the [[Renascence period]], including a great proliferation of their land vehicles throughout the City of Gardens. Their fleet of nautical vessels were finally leveraged in aid of the [[Later Renascence period]]'s [[Questing Houses]], and they secured their status as a key resource for the many Houses of the [[Court]].

This power, however, would lead to a fracturing of Guild leadership, very nearly splitting into a [[Union]] of Houses each specializing in a different form of travel. Instead, the Shipwrights Guild is now controlled by three [[#Shipwright Lordships]] who are aligned for now but are constantly vying for power over the others.

### The Post-Enlightenment Era

Most recently, in the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]], the Guild's engineers would develop the steam engine which would go on to revolutionize both land and sea travel through steam trains and steamships respectively. Additionally, the development of radio transmission by the [[Messengers Guild]] enabled the invention of aeronautic vessels like airships and aerostatics. In this time, they would be one of the many [[Houses of Industry]] to split off and co-found the [[Engineers Union]].

## Classes of the Shipwrights Guild

As one of the oldest [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]], the Shipwrights Guild has a number of internal factions and classes that support and lead its initiatives and industry.

### Shipwright Lordships

A fairly unique feature among the leadership of the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]], the Shipwrights Guild is led by three [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] in control of distinct Shipwright Lordships. Rather than fracture into separate Houses and forming a [[Union]] represented in Court, these three Lordships represent humanity's land, sea, and air travel capabilities as a (mostly) united front.

As of the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]], these factions are seeing an unprecedented level of political power as their steam trains, steamships, and airships are the key to accessing the wider [[Known World]].

### Guild quartermasters

Guild quartermasters are preoccupied with the logistics of long-term, long-range voyages over land, sea, or air, and are primary stakeholders in many such [[Questing Charter|Questing Charters]]. Even after initial expeditions, the Shipwrights Guild and its quartermasters routinely ferry goods and personnel between [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and the far off colonies of the [[Questing Houses]].

The Guild quartermasters have been involved in nearly every Questing Charter, including the failed [[Quest|quests]] of [[House Lightbringer]], the [[Disciples of the Pretender]], and the forbidden quests of the [[Necromancer demons]] of the [[Materialists College]] and the [[New Silver Age]]. 

### Guild navigators

Quickly absorbed into Shipwrights Guild upon its founding was humanity's wayfarers and navigators, who learned from the [[Griot|Griots]] of the [[Sun Elves]] to read the night sky itself. The navigators for the most part came from the remnants of [[House Lightbringer]] and the early [[House of the Sun]], but found more lucrative station in this burgeoning [[Houses of Industry|House of Industry]].

Over the course of the [[Renascence]], many of them would be loaned to the [[Office of the Orator]] to assist with their secretive attempts at recreating the Elven art of [[astral divination]]. Once achieved, this development would usher in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]].

### Guild engineers

The backbone of the Shipwright Guild is its engineers, some of the finest in the history of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and indeed all of the [[Known World]]. Coming from the many [[Houses of Industry]] to found the Guild itself in the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]], they quickly allied themselves with the [[Fisher Queens]] to found the [[Duchy of Stilts]] and their headquarters there: the [[Duchy of Stilts#Shipwrights Quarter|Shipwrights Quarter]].

Their works, both on the Stilts itself and on their first fleet of seafaring vessels, are considered some of the first great [[Humanism|humanist]] works. Later, with their invention of the steam engine, not only would the Guild once again help to usher in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]] but so too would they help to co-found the [[Engineers Union]] which split off from the Houses of Industry.
