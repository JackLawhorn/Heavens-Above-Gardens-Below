## Reception of messianic figures

In a world of magic but not necessarily an overabundance of prophesy and savior figures, the reception of such a character is an interesting facet to explore. At what point in life are they recognized by those around them? When they are recognized, are the out in the open or kept hidden? Are they accepted or rejected by the population of prospective believers? The answers to each of these questions can dramatically alter the story, how its read, and how it will go on to impact the wider world.

The [[Pretender]] was recognized in early childhood and kept hidden first by the [[Silver Wolves]] and then by the [[Orator]] of the [[House of the Sun]]. The act of being hidden plays a significant role in their story, inspiring them to break away from those guarding them and keeping them a secret to make a grand [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revelation]] to the rest of humanity. Then, they've accepted so widely and readily that in just a few years they rise to the station of [[Great House]]. I hope that I'll have done a good enough job showing how significantly [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] itself is transformed by this belief and by the miracles performed both by this messiah and their believers.

The [[Luminary]] was recognized even earlier, her coming [[Luminary#Prophesy of the Luminary|prophesized]] as far back as the [[Elven March]]. The loss of each [[Fallen Houses|Fallen House]] one-by-one and especially the [[fall of the Pretender]] just years earlier had a very significant impact on the approach of the [[Silver Wolves]] and the [[New Silver Age]]. She was kept a secret, so secret that her prophesy was willfully erased from humanity's history and that her mother was stolen away in the night and taken far from the City. Because of this, what was later spun as the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves]], public reception to the Luminary was largely completely opposite to that of the Pretender. She and all of the New Silver Age were disgraced and hated.

I don't expect to have many messiah figures pop up in this project, but ideas converged just right to present both of these two as adopted siblings in a really fun cosmic coincidence. I especially think the Orator who lost both these family members gives a good opportunity to see on a personal level how the entirety of humanity itself might feel after both losses.

## The performance of miracles

Messiah figures are often portrayed as magicians, performing miracles out in the world and gaining believers and disciples through these acts. I think this works really well in fantasy, with classic characters like Gandalf not often casting large-scale, cinematic spells but instead more whimsical effects that are believably captivating and engaging and like something that could attract attention and acclaim.

For the [[Pretender]], their miracles completely transformed [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], but also had widespread consequences in ushering in the [[Psionic Age]]. Able to awaken [[psionics#psionic influence|psionic influence]] in others, their miracles and those of their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] had substantial impact on humanity, bringing them back from a particularly dark place after the earlier losses of the [[Crisis of Hubris]] and especially the [[Red Death period]].

In a way, these miracles can be seen as a metric for the performance and success of such a figure. In contrast, the [[Luminary#Prophesy of the Luminary|much-prophesized]] [[Luminary]], whom the [[Silver Wolves]] and their [[New Silver Age]] sacrificed everything for, is largely a disappointment. Though time may tell, it very much appears like nothing will come of her and her prophesy.
