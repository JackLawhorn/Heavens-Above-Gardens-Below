The Oremongers Guild was one of the original four [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the [[Court]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and the first to [[Fallen Houses|fall]] during the [[Crisis of Hubris]]. Their powerful magics, gained through an [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]] with the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]], made them the greatest mages and warriors in the history of the [[Known World]].

## Connection with the earth

[[Pact magics|Pact-bound]] with the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]], the mages of the Guild have a deep connection with the very earth beneath their feet. They can reach deep to feel vibrations and to sense the presence of any metal or gem deposits.

In worship of their patrons, they also tend to this domain. To the earth motes, whose place in the [[Known World]] is more or less locked in place since the [[roiling of the elements]] was halted, there exist a number of exalted states that the Guild enables them to achieve. The Guild [[#earth shapers]]' construction of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s towers place the motes at a higher altitude and closer to the [[Nyx]]. Other agents of the Guild work to fertilize the earth in and around the City and to promote verdancy and growth there.

## Role within human society

Even more so than the [[Silver Wolves]] of [[Clan Wolfstepper]], the [[Iconic pacts|iconic]] mages of the Guild were as demigods among [[Later Heliotropic Age|Heliotropic]] humanity. Their powers were so great as to shake the earth of the [[Known World]] to its core, and as such they quickly rose to prominence in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

They were titans of industry, the progenitors of the [[Court]]'s many [[Houses of Industry]] and later the inspiration for the [[Engineers Union]]. Both for this and for their great and unstoppable prowess in combat, they were among the original four [[Great House|Great Houses]].

### Powerful warriors

As the Guild continued to hone and develop their magics, there arose a warrior class known as the [[#artificer knights]] who were able to command metals. These powers were much more precise, and the development of new materials like steel exponentially increased their combat viability.

So powerful were the artificer knights that they almost singlehandedly protected the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] from outside threats until their [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]] in the early days of the [[Crisis of Hubris]].

### Humanity's pitfolk and smiths

The Guild worked alongside the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] to mine for raw materials, quickly becoming crucial to nearly every industry and aspect of life in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. They worked to find and extract deposits of useful ores, which they'd then shape and forge into near-perfect arms and armor, further cementing their importance to a newly burgeoning city-state starting from a place of vulnerability.

After their [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]], it would take generations for humanity to learn the arts and sciences of mining and smithing without access to these magics. In fact, their fall sent out a shockwave that reached outside the City itself, rendering even the arms and armor that they had already forged useless.

## Classes of the Guild

The Guild's [[Iconic pacts|iconic]] mages grew to specialize in industries of their own, and would become the [[Known World]]'s greatest miners, smiths, and even warriors by way of the [[#Artificer knights]].

### Earth shapers

The first and most powerful of the Guild's [[Iconic pacts|iconic]] mages were the earth shapers who commanded stone and earth like wet clay. Their magics were not so precise as to make for effective warriors, but they were known to be master architects, engravers, and sculptors who not only constructed the [[Old City]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], but populated it with [[Great Works]].

The earth shapers were respected both for their abilities and for their wisdom. Many of their number became wandering philosophers, walking the City and bringing its streets and structures and walls to life with their very presence. From their number rose the [[Cult of Pythos]] and his theories of [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivism]], and even after their [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]] the former earth shapers retained a certain station as the founders of a great many [[Combat Arts]].

### Assayers

As the Guild's mining expeditions continued, they came across a great many gems and metals and even [[docetic materials]] within the earth. Any [[Docetic materials#silver|silver]] that was discovered was passed directly to the [[Silver Wolves]] of [[Clan Wolfstepper]], but other treasures were assessed, valued, and processed by assayers.

It was specialized assayers called [[aurifaber|aurifabers]] that founded the [[Court#Treasury of the Court|Treasury of the Court]] and minted the gold and copper currencies of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. [[jeweler|jewelers]], who assayed precious gemstones, formed a close relationship with the [[Materialists College]] who studied both the mundane and [[extramundane]] properties of these materials. It was these Guild jewelers who led the expeditions deeper into the earth and meddled with the [[polar onyx deposit]], brought about their [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]], and ushered in the [[Crisis of Hubris]].

### Artificer knights

From the ranks of the [[#assayers]] came the artificer knights who commanded iron and who later developed steel which was even more effective for their needs. So great was the malleability of these metals that their arms and armor appeared to have a life of their own in combat.

Their [[armiger]] squires, themselves artificer knights in training, pushed carts stocked full of steel billets that could be commanded at a moments notice. This source of raw material had to be conserved as difficulty of accessing these magics scaled with the weight of the materials used. It is said that a flash of their swords could cut through solid stone at three strides' distance before reforming as their armor.

The greatest warriors in all of the [[Known World]], perhaps even including the [[Sun Elves]] themselves, their services were in high demand throughout the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]. Working as mercenaries to fund their never-ending quest to perfect their arms and armor, they were valuable political tokens traded to and between the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]].
