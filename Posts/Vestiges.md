The Vestiges of the [[Dragon]] were powerful cosmic entities that for eons floated aimlessly across the [[Nyx]]: [[#Oblivion]] and [[#Entropy]]. Previously a part of the Dragon himself, they were rent from the whole by the divine strikes of the [[Angels]], and as such were inadvertently given name and form and made real.

More powerful than the [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]] themselves, the Vestiges were closer in influence to the [[Laws of Power]] which govern the [[Prime Material Sphere]]. Although they were felled by the Angels in their endless war against the forces of the Dragon, their influence remains in the form of their children: the [[Umbral Aspects]].

## Oblivion

Oblivion's domain was that of the void: real space nevertheless devoid of the creations of [[Ylem]]. They could reasonably be understood as a dark reflection of the [[Laws of Power|Law of Power]] called Space. Before its death at the hands of the [[Angels]], Oblivion birthed the deep dark [[Shades]] and the [[shade motes]] that populate them. In death, this Vestige was split into the [[Umbral Aspects]] of [[Low Ones|Madness]] and [[Fallen Son|Despair]].

## Entropy

Entropy's domain was that of ultimate destruction: the inevitable death of reality and all the creation of [[Ylem]]. They could reasonably be understood as a dark reflection of the [[Laws of Power|Law of Power]] called Time. Before its death at the hands of the [[Angels]], Entropy birthed the thorny black [[nyxblight]] which grows across the [[Nyx]] strangling and suffocating reality itself. In death, this Vestige was split into the [[Umbral Aspects]] of [[Red Court|Hunger]] and [[An≈çmalos|Wrath]].
