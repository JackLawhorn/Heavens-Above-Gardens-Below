Clan Wolfstepper is one of the oldest surviving [[human clans]], arising along the [[Elven March]] when people from all of the disparate clans were called to form an [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]] with the [[Wolf Mother]]. Since [[Birth of the Silver Wolves|that fateful night]], Clan Wolfstepper has been as demigods among the rest of humanity. Most notable are the [[Silver Wolves]], elite trackers, hunters, and warriors who rose to be named [[naming of the Great Houses|one of the original four]] [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the [[Court]].

With the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall of the Silver Wolves]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], the Clan was splintered into the [[New Silver Age]] and the rest of their population who remained within [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], now trapped within the [[Argent Ghetto]] for the crimes of their brethren.

## Behavior

After [[Iconic pact of Clan Wolfstepper|forming]] their [[Iconic pact of Clan Wolfstepper|iconic pact with the Wolf Mother]], the newly formed [[Silver Wolves]] returned noticeably different, their nature more wolf-like in many ways. Their behavior and social interactions changed significantly, aligning more closely with those of a pack of wolves. Previously coming from most of the disparate [[human clans]], they largely broke off these ties to become more insular within their new pack.

Sub-groups would arise within the Clan, but the rule of the pack was above all but the word of the [[Lunar Aspects#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]] herself. The pack was to be protected from both harm brought by enemies and by unnecessary mixing with their human neighbors. They were the last of their kind, the last wolves of the [[Known World]], and the survival and proliferation of the pack was paramount to the Wolf Mother's very first prophecy:

### Connection with the night

Though not truly nocturnal, their connection with the [[silver moon]] as well as their enhanced senses make the children of Clan Wolfstepper well suited to the environment of the night. During the [[Elven March|Elven March period]], this made them proficient night watchers, even more so than the ever vigilant [[Sun Elves]] of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]]. Later – after the founding of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] – it was common to see a squad roaming the streets or the rooftops of the [[Old City]] during the day, but a great many more would go completely unnoticed at night.

### Rendezvous with the Wolf Mother

Every full moon, the elders of the pack would recuse themselves of their human neighbors and venture deep into the forests to summon the counsel of their [[iconic pacts|patron]], the [[Lunar Aspects#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]]. This mysterious ritual would not be understood by the humans until after the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of their protectors the [[Silver Wolves]]. Although the Silver Wolves were seen and treated with much reverence, this was the source of constant speculation by the other [[human clans|clans]].

## Factions of Clan Wolfstepper

### New Silver Age

> For more, see [[New Silver Age]].

The [[New Silver Age]] is a [[cults|cult]] formed out of the [[Silver Wolves]] and around a [[Luminary#Prophesy of the Luminary|prophesized]] messiah called the [[Luminary]]. When the mother became pregnant with this daughter of the [[Wolf Mother]] herself, the they departed from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and brought about the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves]].

Throughout the [[Renascence]], they have seen significant [[New Silver Age#Renascence decline|decline]] and now exist only as disparate, ineffectual subsects throughout the [[Known World]]. They are roaming knights, vagrants, outlaws, and often mercenaries selling their services to the [[Questing Houses]] and their [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]].

### Clan Wolfstepper within the Argent Ghetto

> For more, see [[Argent Ghetto]].

Though Clan Wolfstepper is most remembered for the [[Silver Wolves]] and the treacherous [[New Silver Age]] they became, they represent a sizable portion of the human population after millennia of intermixing with the other [[human clans]]. Throughout the [[Decline of cland culture]] over the course of the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], Clan Wolfstepper was the most prominent human clan to retain their community and culture. With the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves]], the [[House of the Sun]] and the rest of humanity greatly persecuted all hailing from this heritage in lieu of punishing the New Silver Age themselves.

As of the [[Early Renascence period]], the vast majority of Clan Wolfstepper's population lives within the [[Argent Ghetto]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. There, they are under the watchful eye of the [[Jurisweard]] and are not able to freely leave their ghetto.
