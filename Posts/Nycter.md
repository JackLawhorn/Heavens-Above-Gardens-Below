## Anatomy

The Nycter are a mammalian race of the [[Orior]] covered in a thick coat of fur. They are primarily characterized by elongated snouts that resemble that of a wolf or fox, and large ears that extend from head.

While possessing powerful senses of smell and hearing, the Nycter have small and poorly developed eyes, possibly as a result of generations born and died under the eternal shade of the [[Nyxblight Tree]]'s canopy. Their senses are bolstered by their [[organic magics]], which afford them the ability to sense via [[#echolocation]].

When their arms are outstretched, they reveal a thin membrane that stretches between long, flexible finger bones and connects to the torso. Their snouts combined with these [[#vestigial wings]] give them the appearance of "winged foxes", which is how they were referred to by the [[Necromancer demons]] of the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fallen]] [[Materialists College]] upon their first encounters.

### Vestigial wings

While their vestigial wings are not large or powerful enough to enable flight, they do indicate a past ability not only to glide but to achieve sustained flight. Legends tell of a great "cloud" of millions of Nycter capable of sustained flight. This is a unique characteristic among the races of the [[Orior]], of whom no other flying races have been encountered by humanity anywhere in the [[Known World]].

Now, these vestigial flight organs enable the Nycter to be effective swimmers, as well as to shield themselves from the elements. They are known to wrap themselves in these membranes while they sleep or to hide their presence from predators. They are also an effective means by which to appear larger and intimidate predators.

### Diet

Their snouts and fangs enable them to effectively feed on fruits, nectar, and pollen, which are their main food sources. They also predate on insects and even some small vertebrates. Their coat is often home to a number of fleas and mites which they eat while grooming themselves and others.

Those inflicted with the [[Red Death]] have also [[#Mutations|mutated]] to drink the blood of other mammals, although this is not a natural diet for the race.

## Nycter colonies

Some Nycter lead solitary lives, while others live in large colonies to lessen the risk of predation. These colonies take a fission-fusion social structure, where large numbers congregate in one roosting area, along with breaking up and mixing of subgroups. Within these societies, Nycter are able to maintain long-term relationships, often consisting of matrilineally related females and their dependent offspring.

When not flying, Nycter hang upside down from their feet, a posture known as roosting. It is thought that this too is a vestigial behavior from a time when flying was their primary means of travel. Roosting neighbors engage in food sharing and mutual grooming which strengthen social bonds.

### Communication

Besides the [[Elven Tongue]] – which the Nycter acquired upon meeting the [[Sun Elves]] along their [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March|Post-Heliotropic March]] – this race has a rich [[pre-contact]] language of their own. The songs of the Nycter are used to attract mates, find roost partners, and coordinate in combat. They are low-frequency and can travel long distances.

## Organic magics of the Nycter

The [[organic magics]] of the Nycter primarily serve to increase their sensory abilities. Most prominent is their ability to emit ultrasonic sounds which produce echoes that allow them to "see" the environment around them in a process called echolocation. This greatly bolsters their perceptive abilities as their eyesight is underdeveloped.

Nycter have also displayed a magnetoreceptive sense which is also possessed by the avian races of the [[Noble beasts]]. This affords them a high sensitivity to the [[Known World]]'s magnetic field which is created by the [[polar onyx deposit|polar onyx deposits]] that exist under [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

## Curse of the Red Court

The once-great Nycter colony that called the [[Nyxblight Tree]] home has, over the course of millennia, been subject to the corruptive influence of the [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] known as the [[Red Court]], which calls that place home. Despite significant [[#Red Death: Symptoms and natural resistance|natural resistance]] to its plague, the [[Red Death]], it has ultimately led to the colony's decline almost to the point of extinction.

### Red Death: Symptoms and natural resistance 

The Nycter have displayed a significant natural resistance to the [[Red Death]], which likely helped to mitigate the spread of the plague from its source in the [[Nyxblight Tree]] until the arrival of [[House Lightbringer]] and the remains of their [[Quest|questing party]]. They have seen only minor physical transformation over the course of generations and do not appear to suffer from the reanimation of the flesh that was seen during the [[Red Death period]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

The most prominent symptom that is carried by the afflicted Nycter is the [[Red Death#The Hunger|Hunger]] for flesh and blood. They have seen a number of [[#mutations]] that enable them to better predate upon other mammals and satiate this need.

### Mutations

Carrying the [[Red Death]] over generations has led to a number of mutations which allow the Nycter to better predate upon other mammals and satiate their [[Red Death#The Hunger|Hunger]] for flesh and blood. These are fairly easily noticeable at a glance, as many of them affect the facial structure. A shorter snout makes them better suited for ripping and tearing flesh rather than eating nectar and pollen. In addition, they have fewer teeth but more pronounced fangs.
