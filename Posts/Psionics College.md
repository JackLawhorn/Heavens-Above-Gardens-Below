The Psionics College rose from the losses of the [[Crisis of Hubris]] to become the largest [[College]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. After the [[fall of the Pretender]], it was them who continued to develop the newly discovered field of [[psionics]]. The halls of the [[Materialists College]] – which had laid vacant since their own [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]] – were quickly populated by this new class of scholar.

Their burgeoning abilities have made them powerful allies and indispensable assets to both the [[House of the Sun]] and the many [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]]. Their [[Agents of the psionics college|agents]] traverse the City unseen, and their behind-the-scenes machinations have great impact on matters of the Court. Now, in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], they are one of very few with the influence to vie for [[Great House|Great Houseship]].

## Stewards of objectivist psionics

After the [[fall of the pretender|fall]] of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] and their [[mystic psionics]], it was the Psionics College that carried their torch forward through the rest of the [[Psionic Age]]. Its founders were among those awakened by the [[Pretender]] themself but who – being [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist scholars]] – did not follow this prophetic figure on their [[Quest into Oblivion]]. Instead, they stayed in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and, for over an age hence, have studied the field of [[psionics]] as a science rather than as a branch of the magics.

Throughout the [[Early Renascence period]], the Psionics College pioneered their field, both testing and defining their [[psionics#psionic abilities|abilities]] and exploring the new frontier of the [[Psionic Sphere]]. Under their stewardship, psionics has not only grown significantly in prominence, but [[psionics#psionic influence|psionic influence]] among the human population has also seen a meteoric rise. Now, in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], every [[Lord Representative]] of the [[Court]] and every warrior class of the [[Jurisweard]] are trained in low-level psionics.

## Leaders of the Scholars Quarter

Just as the [[Scholars Quarter]] had grown up around the [[Materialists College]] and the many [[scholars of the City|scholars]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] had looked to them as leaders and as representatives in [[Court]], the Psionics College who rose to prominence after them would come to fill a similar roll in the City. With few exceptions – the [[Vergonic War]] being chief among them – the [[College]] has served to protect scholastic integrity and freedom from political influence.

## Agents of politics, intelligence, and intrigue

The powerful [[psionics]] of the [[College]] and their many [[Agents of the Psionics College|agents]] has allowed them to become a powerful political player in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], at once operating both behind the scenes and in the forefront of all matters of the [[Court]]. Their tutors and [[Agents of the Psionics College#College Silencers|Silencers]] are employed by the [[House|Houses]] to protect their secrets, but all for a cost. It is said that all information in the City and its Court flows through the Psionics College before reaching its destination.
