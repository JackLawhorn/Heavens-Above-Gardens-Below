Atop the [[Elven Signaltower]], two Keepers of the [[House of the Sun]]'s [[House of the Sun#Daywatch|Daywatch]] tended to its ever-burning [[nyxfire]] flame as they had through months of this [[Long Daylight]]. The [[Known World]] and its peoples, disconnected from the night sky – from the [[Nyx]] itself – had suffered much from this ill-conceived gambit of the [[Materialists College]], and none as much as the Daywatch themselves.

The physical effects began to manifest after only weeks, and the toll of the emotional and psychological damage would not be fully understood for decades to come. The Keepers, brave souls to a one, surely bore the scars of their service. The falling off of the hair. The burning and melting and cauterization of the flesh. The blinding of eyes and the deafening of the ears. The loss of entire limbs into the ever-burning, ever-consuming flames. Many among their ranks had not survived the noble charge to which they had volunteered.

And yet the light must burn and be tended to still, for it was all that held back the tide of darkness and death that besieged [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

So the shifts of the Keepers were shortened, rotations coming thrice a day. In truth, it wasn't much work. The Signaltower's mechanisms which had previously directed the light and created the effect of day and night sat cold and untouched. No, the role of the Keepers it seemed was simply to keep the [[nyxfire motes]] appeased.

Many told them stories. Anecdotes from their own lives, what they had been and wanted to be. The happenings of the City, of what it was like before the [[Red Death]] and of the hardships it housed now. Tales and legends from humanity's history, of the victories and heroes of the [[Heliotropic Age]].

Others pleaded or even bargained with the motes. They recounted the recent losses of the [[Campaigns against the Red Court|campaigns]] against the [[Red Court]], vented their frustrations that the [[Ylem]] dared not intervene, and confessed a wavering of the faith that the [[Sun Elves]] had imparted to humanity.

Such were the conversations, in fact, that were had before the flames of the Elven Signaltower on the night of the [[Burning]]. And, as if their cries for help had finally reached the ears of the unknowable nyxfire motes, the flames themselves began to respond. The Keepers who had been on shift, their names and identities lost forever to history, were enveloped by the pure nyxfire which had surged towards them. Incredibly, they were not vaporized nor even burned. Rather, they bore witness to a vision, saw things how they imagined the Ylem must see such wonders.

First, they saw the City from above. The harsh light of the Signaltower illuminated all but a pocket of pitch black, what must be the forces of the Red Court beyond the [[Red Death period City of Gardens#The warding line|warding line]]. Suddenly, they saw the light falter. In their state they could not be sure if it was happening in this moment or in the near future but they were sure of its truth nonetheless. The hungry void rushed forward, crushing all of humanity's walls and defenses until the City had been engulfed. They saw as the very tower they stood in came toppling down and its light extinguished forever.

Their perspective then zoomed out further until they saw all the Known World, for the Red Court had not stopped at the outer walls of the City. They heard the cries of the [[Orior]] and of the [[noble beasts]], or perhaps *felt* the extinguishing of their peoples and the [[benighted|benighting]] of their lands. The darkness stretched from pole to pole, from the [[Deep Deserts]] to the north to the [[Great Dark Cold]] to the south. All light extinguished, the Known World itself became invisible, as dark as the [[Dragon]] itself.

Zooming out further still, they witnessed the falling of the Nyx itself. World after world, sun after sun extinguished and fallen to the void. They saw the shape of the Dragon burst from the chains of reality that had been forged by the [[Angels]] themselves, going on to consume all of creation until it was all that remained.

Lastly, they found themselves back in the City, which blessedly had not yet fallen. At first, they could not be sure if this too was part of the vision of the nyxfire motes. They found themselves standing not atop the Elven Signaltower but in its shadow far below. Before their eyes, the flames leapt from the place where they had rested since the [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founding of the City]] itself and shot down into the nest of shadows. The flames rose so high they seemed to reach the Nyx above, and all of humanity stood and watched as they razed and leveled all in their path.

And then they came back to reality, two Keepers standing before the flames to which they tended. Exactly what they had experienced they had no way of knowing, and would likely never fully comprehend.

What they did know – one last warning of the nyxfire motes – was that the great Burning they had witnessed would begin in only one hour.
