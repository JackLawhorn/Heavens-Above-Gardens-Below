## Immense size of the Nyxblight Tree

The Nyxblight Tree is the largest living thing in the [[Known World]] – or it would be if it was, in fact, either living or a single organism. It stands taller than any structure, even the [[Elven Signaltower]] in the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]]. Its exact height is unknown and believed to be near immeasurable with current technology, but its base has been measured to be approximately one thousand strides in circumference. And the thorns that extend from the nyxblight are at points up to a stride long themselves.

Impossibly high above the earth, its canopy expands outward so far as to reproduce the darkness of night. The gaps between its yellowed leaves even mimic the pinpricks of light that dot the night sky. But make no mistake: you are far from the [[Nyx]] and the divinity of [[Ylem]] here.

### Roots and tendrils

Expanding outward around its base is a vast network of roots, just as inky black and thorny and sickly as the rest of it. They begin two to three storeys above the ground the tree itself is planted in and have grown outward and downward in a dizzying, chaotic pattern. Traveling up this root system to the tree itself, one will find the roots have grown into segmented mazes and interconnected pathways and uncanny-seeming stairways.

They have traveled hundreds of strides from the base by the time they worm their way into the earth. Some plunge deep into the surface of the [[Known World]] and others make their way to the shores of the [[Sink]]. It's impossible to know where these tendrils end, and it's even been thought that other growths found far from the tree itself – such as those exposed in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] during the [[Red Death period]] – have in fact originated all the way from here.

### Depth and interior

Making your way past the labyrinthine root system and upwards towards the base of the Nyxblight Tree, any unfortunate travelers are surprised to find the entrance to an expansive interior within. The original, mundane tree around which the [[Nyxblight]] has grown – if, in fact, there ever was one – has long since died and rotted and decomposed away. In its place is a network of tunnels winding downwards and connecting dark, open chambers.

At their deepest point, protected by the impenetrable layer of armor that is the tree's root system, is a single chamber from which emanates a deep red light: the unholy den of the [[Red Court]], [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] of Hunger.

## Ecosystem around the Nyxblight Tree

The Nyxblight Tree's presence – or perhaps that of the [[Red Court]] – has warped this place and generated the largest [[Shades|Shade]] in the [[Known World]] apart from the [[Great Dark Cold]] itself. This and the overgrowth of [[Nyxblight]] has created a unique ecosystem within which live a number of [[Noble beasts]] and races of the [[Orior]], as well as an immeasurable population of [[shade motes]] and other horrors of the [[Umbral Aspects]].

### Nyxblight ecosystem

The defining inhabitant of this ecosystem is, of course, the [[Nyxblight]] itself. In its [[extramundane]] growth, it has developed personality and culture and goals indicative of a certain sentience – though whether this is the influence of the [[Red Court]] is unknown. It is possible that they are connected, just as the [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] is known to be connected to those afflicted with its [[Red Death|plague]].

Like the mundane flora of the Known World, it reacts to food, light, and other external stimuli, though its response it quite unique: the tendrils shy away from the light of [[Ylem]] instead of growing towards it, seeks out flesh and blood rather than water and fertile soil, and has been reported to attack those who approach the tree.

In this extreme overgrowth, not often seen elsewhere, the thorny vines have even evolved to reproduce the form of the [[Orior]]. These [[Nyxblight#Blights|blights]] move and react slowly, but their spear-like extremities and thorn-coated flesh make them dangerous foes.

### Nycter

Once a noble race of the [[Orior]], all that remains of the [[Nycter]] are the small, sickly population that has withstood and survived the influence of the [[Red Court]] upon this land. First encountered by humanity when the [[Quest|questing party]] of [[House Lightbringer]] came to this accursed place, they were the ones who first passed the [[Red Death]] to humanity and ushered in the [[Red Death period]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

The few Nycter who remain live within the root systems, internal tunnels, and even the canopy of the Nyxblight Tree. Primarily living off fruits and flowers, they scour this place for the few branches that still produce them. They have become so accustomed to the darkness of the [[Shades]] that expeditions beyond the shade of the tree's canopy have all failed.

It is expected that their kind will die out completely within the next [[Ages of the Known World|age]].

### Goblin clans

The Nyxblight Tree is also refuge to a number of [[goblin clans]] who, born of the [[Wild Magics]], have few other suitable homes across the [[Known World]]. Resistant to the [[Red Death]], they live here without interference from the [[Red Court]] and have even adapted to survive off of the flesh of the thorny [[Nyxblight]] vines themselves.

They have largely settled the canopy of the tree and, after generations of warring with the [[Nycter]] who called this place home first, have mostly claimed this territory for themselves.

## Extramundane properties

The Nyxblight Tree of course possesses a number of [[extramundane]] properties with which it both protects itself and aggresses against those who enter into its domain. This is partially due to its status as a [[Shades|Shade]], which naturally affords it a number of properties as well as interfering with one's connection to other magics.

The thorny [[Nyxblight]] vines here grow at a particularly rapid rate, and have greater abilities to respond to stimuli. It is also believed that a creature treading on one tendril is felt by many others, perhaps all the way up to the canopy above. In this way, it acts as a single mind.

### Illusions

Most prominent of its [[extramundane]] properties is its ability to create illusions within the minds of those who see it. In the cases of both the [[Sun Elves]] on their [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March|Post-Heliotropic March]] and the [[Quest|questing party]] of [[House Lightbringer]], the tree was perceived as its true self but as a beautiful, living, and vibrant organism. This is assumed to be equal parts defense mechanism and lure, protecting it from attack by the forces of the [[Angels]] who would wish it harm and drawing in vulnerable travelers for it to feed upon.
