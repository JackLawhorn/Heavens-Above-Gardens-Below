As a consequence of the losses of the [[Red Death period]] and the [[Crisis of Hubris]] at large, humanity is forced into their most vulnerable position and goes on to explore potentially destructive new magical and technological powers with which to arm themselves against the threats of the future. Which of these are seen as positive, beneficial progress and which are seen as threats to humanity and the wider [[Known World]]?

## External competition

Based on where humanity's at in their history and the threats they've come across, my main focus here has been on external competition. Humanity, born without [[organic magics]] of their own, must arm themselves with powers so that they might be able to compete with other races of the [[Orior]] who may wish them harm and now threats such as the [[Red Court]] and the other [[Umbral Aspects]].

How do we arm ourselves against threats unknown, effectively arming ourselves against the future? How would be approach such developments? Where do they come from and how are they used? How might such developments have other uses outside of warfare and combat?

## Internal competition

Beyond any [[#external competition]], there's also necessarily a degree of internal competition that this would promote. The [[Materialists College]], for example, found themselves completely unable to to find a suitable solution to the problem of the [[Red Death]] or the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]]. Their scholars are not only inspired to fight such threats in the future, but also to reclaim their prominence in the [[Court]] and in society within [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

How will a fall from grace, especially from a station as lofty as a [[Great House]] of the Court, inspire a person or faction going forward? How far would we go to reclaim lost prominence? In which different ways might that prominence possibly be reclaimed? How would such endeavors be seen by others in this society?

## Consequences

I think when most of us think of an arms race we think about the consequences before the potential benefits. The invention of the atom bomb by Oppenheimer and then the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki aren't celebrated as groundbreaking achievements by the larger public but rather are considered some of the worst moments in human history. What might the darkest moments of this fictional arms race look like? What are the consequences on [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and the wider [[Known World]]? I'll be exploring this with the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]] of the [[Materialists College]] and the birth of the [[Necromancer demons]].

But also, what are the consequences for the engineers of these horrors? In the real world, we aren't blessed with true justice: there are very little consequences for those who committed these atrocities, which are justified by the second world war as well as by past and continued racism against the Japanese. In this setting, however, we can explore what that real justice – either successful or failed – might look like.
