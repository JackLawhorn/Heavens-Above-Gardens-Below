Progeny of the [[Umbral Aspects]], the thorny, black nyxblight vines are an unstoppable growth strangling the [[Known World]]. It protrudes from every crack, extending upwards from deep below and stabbing upwards. The thorns and beasts infected by them spread the [[Red Death]] in humans and other races of the [[Orior]].

## Draconic heritage

The nyxblight vines are a common sight wherever an [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] or its influence can be found. Their source is unknown, but they are not understood to be [[Aspect|Aspects]] of the [[Dragon]] themselves. They were given life by [[Entropy]], child of the [[Dragon]] itself, before it was struck down by the [[Angels]]. They are a rot upon the [[Known World]] and the reality of the [[Nyx]]

Curiously, they appear to have [[Red Court#Connection to the Nyxblight|some particular connection]] to the [[Red Court]] more so than to its siblings. Its den deep within the root systems of the [[Nyxblight Tree]] has the greatest density of this overgrowth ever reported in the Known World. Moreover, the thorns of the vines themselves were purported during the [[Red Death period]] to transmit the [[Red Death]] themselves and perhaps even to serve as sensory organs connected to the soldiers of the Red Court.

## Extramundane properties

Nyxblight displays a number of properties of interest, including [[extramundane]] [[#growth|growth and resiliency]]. It does not need air or water or light, and in fact it [[benighted|benights]] the surrounding environment from the divine light of [[Ylem]] as is common with those that share its [[#Draconic heritage]].

Additionally, it is thought to have [[Red Court#Connection to the Nyxblight|some sort of connection]] to the [[Red Court]]. It seems to act as a kind of sensory organ with some connection to the [[Red Court]] and its soldiers. Its thorns are even able to transmit the [[Red Death]].

## Growth

Nyxblight vines appear throughout the [[Known World]] in overgrowths and thickets, especially in and around areas exposed to the [[Umbral Aspects]] and their influence. Their piercing, spear-like shoots erupt out of the earth and spread out to strangle and conquer the surrounding flora and fauna.

Nyxblight is extremely resilient, growing back when injured. They can be hacked apart by blades, though all but the most well-crafted will be dulled or damaged by repeated swings. Severed lengths have even been known to display autotomy as the soldiers of the [[Red Court]] do, going on to live and grow as their own independent organisms. Indeed, nyxblight vines will nearly always grow back unless in contact with [[Docetic materials#Silver|silver]], flames, or the light of [[Ylem]].

### Leaves, flowers, and fruits

Occasionally, the nyxblight vines produce leaves, fruits, and flowers just like mundane flora. Their leaves are yellowed and their flowers are pure white but grow out of black bulbs. Like the great [[Nyxblight Tree]], these stark colors grant the growths a very different appearance to those not looking closely: that of a healthy, even beautiful organism.

The fruit is, of course, blood red. They have a peculiar taste: bitter at first and then overwhelmingly sweet. Those who eat from the nyxblight vines quickly become addicted and find themselves unable to stomach much else.

### Blights

Some bear a deadly progeny: sentient extensions of the overgrowth that take on a form similar to that of the [[Orior]], which are known as blights. Their movements are slow and stilted, and they are fairly easily dispatched with silver or flames, but they can wreak havoc in tight spaces such as those of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]. Their bodies are covered with the same needle-sharp thorns as the vines, allowing them to effectively rip and tear into flesh.

Finding themselves far from their home thicket, some blights have been known bury themselves, perhaps branching outward into a new growth.

## Nyxblight in the Known World

The densest overgrowth of nyxblight seen in the [[Known World]] is centered around the great [[Nyxblight Tree]] on the eastern shore of the [[Great Sea]]. Its size and scope is truly unimaginable, an entire region unto its own. The vines' tendrils crawl outward from the trunk of the tree to extend in all directions, even growing into the salty waters of the [[Sink]].

Visiting the [[Black Coast]] now, a narrow trail of nyxblight growth can be seen traveling far into the [[lands to the south]]: the path of the [[Red King]] and his master the [[Red Court]]. This growth is dotted with brilliant leaves, flowers, and fruits that almost mask the accursed history of the place.

> Nyxblight also has an infamous history in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], where it saw rampant, unchecked growth during the [[Red Death period]]. For more on that, see [[Spread of the Red Death#Spread throughout the City|Spread of the Red Death > Spread throughout the City]].
