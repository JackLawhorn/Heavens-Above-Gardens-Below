A pact is a relationship between two parties that is itself imbued with magics. These parties are called the "pact-bound".

## Mechanics of a pact

A pact, once entered into, takes form within the [[Astral Sphere]] – home of the [[Ylem]] – as a spectral connection between the [[aura|auras]] of both parties. [[Albedo]] is transferred through this connection, granting magics to one or both parties depending on the type of pact formed and the terms by which it was entered into.

### Components of a pact

The scholars and paladins of the Iconic Houses have defined three primary factors in the forming of pacts: [[#type|type]], [[#terms|terms]], and [[#consent|consent]].

#### Type

The type of pact is dependent on the relative magics of the pact-bound parties, and dictate the direction in which [[albedo]] flows from one to the other. Below are three types of pacts that are defined, documented, and recognized.

[[Iconic pacts]] are formed between an iconic mage and a patron [[Aspect|Aspect of Ylem]]. These pacts are generally machinations by which the Aspect asserts influence within the [[Prime Material Sphere]], and can grant powerful, primal magics significantly more powerful than those of the other pacts.

[[Mutualist pacts]] are formed between two living beings rather than an iconic mage and a patron Aspect. Typically significantly closer in relative magics, both parties benefit greatly from this relationship. Mutualist pacts are most commonly formed between the races of the [[Orior]] and a race of the [[Discoveries in the Known World#noble beasts|noble beasts]].

[[Hexecraft pacts]] are formed between a witch and the [[animalcules]] within their very body – the [[monad]] to the [[legion]] of physical form – or those of other living things. Through these pacts, the witches can draw albedo from their own form and into their [[aura]]. In this process of drawing out the albedo, the witch gains a certain degree of control over the pact-bound cells and can transform them with enough skill.

#### Terms

The terms are defined before the pact itself is formed. These terms generally define specifics on the flow of [[albedo]] and magics between the [[aura|auras]] of the [[Pact magics|pact-bound]], as well as terms by which the pact may be altered or [[#Breaking a pact|broken]]. Terms of iconic pacts generally include acts of worship that must be carried out by the pact-bound in the name of their patron.

In the case of an iconic or [[hexecraft pact]], the terms are defined by the patron, although it is still within the ability of the less powerful pact-bound party not to give consent and enter into the pact.

#### Consent

Finally, informed consent must be given by both parties for a pact to be formed – meaning that the type and terms of the pact must be understood by both parties.

[[Hexecraft]], by which infinitesimal pacts are formed with the [[animalcules]] within one's form rather than with the individual themselves, was originally thought to be forced upon one without their consent – called "hexes" or "curses".

### Breaking a pact

Formed within the [[Astral Sphere]], terms are more or less binding for all but the most powerful of patron [[Aspect|Aspects]], but can indeed be broken by their pact-bound according to the terms.

In the case of [[iconic pacts]] entered into with a patron Aspect, the simple revoking of consent is often not enough to break it. Some iconic pacts are even genetically inherited, passing these magics across generations and down entire bloodlines.

#### Warlock, the Pact Breakers

Those who have broken pacts are known by an [[Organic magics of the Elven Legion#The Elven tongue|Old Elven]] word, "warlock", and are often permanently scarred by the act. The breaking of a pact, especially without carefully following any agreed-upon terms to do so, severs the tie formed within the [[Astral Sphere]] and [[benighted|benights]] the warlock's [[aura]] there. Depending on the type and terms of the pact itself, this scar may extend beyond the warlock's [[albedo]] and to their mind and form as well.

Warlock may find it difficult to form the same type of pact, to form any pact at all, or even to wield other types of magics entirely due to the damage caused to their aura.
