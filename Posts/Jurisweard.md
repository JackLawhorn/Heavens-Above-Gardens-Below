The Jurisweard is a loose [[Union]] of [[House|Houses]] – each with some warrior class or classes of their own – with special powers to enforce the law of the [[Court]] in accordance with the [[Public Record]]'s [[Hall of Precedent]]. Over the long history of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], this has most prominently featured the following factions:

## House Lightbringer

> For more, see [[House Lightbringer]].

[[House Lightbringer]]'s Torchbearer knights were among the first law keepers in the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]], restless in their new home and called to greatness by their reverence of the [[Elven Legion]]. They were walking judges, juries, and executioners, holding public sentencings in the streets where the crime was committed in which the victim, the defendant, and any witnesses – either witnesses to the crime or character witnesses – gave testimony to influence the punishment.

During the day, the sounds of their mounts' hooves and the clanking of their spears were enough to dissuade the populace from committing any wrongdoings nearby. At night, their keepers of the [[Elven Signaltower]] were able to see the light of their torches moving throughout the City's streets, keeping her people safe from the night.

In the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], the [[House of the Sun]] is all that remains of House Lightbringer, and they are preoccupied with the work and judgements of the [[Orator]] rather than enforcement.

## The Silver Wolves

> For more, see [[Silver Wolves]].

Prior to [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|their fall]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], Clan Wolfstepper's [[Silver Wolves]] were prominent members of the Jurisweard. In contrast to [[House Lightbringer]] and their calling to serve, the service of the Silver Wolves was more or less out of necessity as humanity's first empowered protectors and one of the factions most proficient at more complex investigations.

The Silver Wolves were a common sight as they patrolled the streets, public squares and gardens, and even the rooftops of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]]. These stoic warriors donned [[docetic materials#silver|silver]] arms, armor, and cloaks in human form, though their small patrols often included at least one in wolf form. Their very presence cast a sense of safety and security on the populace – one they would unfortunately come to miss.

In the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], most of their rank are reduced to little more than mercenaries subsisting off of contracts with the [[Questing Houses]] and their colonies. The remnants of this [[Fallen Houses|Fallen House]] remain as an oppressed class in the City, and the strongest among their number may serve as the Jurisweard's [[Bloodhounds]] in exchange for greater privileges.

## The Oremongers Guild

> For more, see [[Oremongers Guild]].

The [[Oremongers Guild]] and their [[iconic pacts|iconic magics]] were humanity's first true superpower: forging both weapons and warriors of unstoppable force. Most famous were their [[Oremongers Guild#artificer knights|artificer knights]], who freely controlled armor and arms of the Guild's flexible steel to become the most elite fighting force in human history. More akin to a walking artillery weapon, the artificer knights primarily served as a deterrent that would only be unleashed on the most powerful of enemies.

The artificer knights were unmissable – the power of the [[Ylem]] themselves walking through the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]. Their heavy armor shone in the sun and the sound of steel clinking announced their presence from blocks away. Of course, as was the prerogative of the Guild, they were also little more than mercenaries whose highest bidder thankfully was the [[Court]]. Unless paid to do otherwise, the artificer knights primarily remained in the Guild's quarry to the northeast.

Now, in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], the survivors of [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|the Guild's fall]] still operate as the [[Earthen Orders]]: a union of humanist, monastic cultures proficient in martial combat. Though Houseless – meaning an entity without [[House|Houseship]] – the Earthen Orders have grown to regain much of their influence since the dawn of the [[Crisis of Hubris]]. Their interests are presented by the rest of the Jurisweard in Court and they are a common choice as [[Hand of the Court]] in various smaller matters.

## Paladins of the Iconic Houses

The paladins of the of the [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] walk the streets of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] representing their [[iconic pacts|patrons]], protecting their domains, and exerting their influence on the [[Known World]]. Unlike the [[Oremongers Guild#artificer knights|artificer knights]] – who represented the [[Oremongers Guild]] but not the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] themselves – the work of paladins is expressly religious in nature and often an act of worship specified in their iconic pact itself.

Since their forming, the work of the paladins of the Iconic Houses has largely been overseen by the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] as a sort of religious police force. In this role, the Canon manages a shadow [[Court]] of all the City's the patron [[Ylem]] and their constant vying for power.

## The Mercenary Corps

The [[Mercenary Corps]] connects a network of otherwise Houseless sellswords that operate throughout the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]. Many of these soldiers are simple bounty hunters recognized by the Jurisweard and deputized to defuse certain classes of threats, but others are commonly engaged by the various [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]] for ad hoc work or to sit on the cabinets of their [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]].

Many Houseless warriors encircle the drain of the Mercenary Corps, including former [[Bloodhounds]], [[Apotropaics]], and [[Agents of the Psionics College#College Silencers|College Silencers]].
