The sighting of smoke from [[House Lightbringer]]'s signal fire was celebrated as a much needed victory in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Court]]. The [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] just months earlier had had a devastating effect on the populace and its morale, and it was thought that [[House Lightbringer's Questing Charter#The questing party|House Lightbringer's own questing party]] had very likely also fallen without the support of their [[Oremongers Guild#Artificer knights|artificer knights]]. With this promising development, the [[Shipwrights Guild]] was quick to dispatch three [[Sink]]-faring vessels – the first of their kind – on their maiden voyage. Leaving from the [[Duchy of Stilts#Shipwrights Quarter|Shipwrights Quarter]] in the newly founded [[Duchy of Stilts]], they followed along the [[Sun Coast]] with supplies and room for passengers and cargo to be stowed and brought back to the City.

Little did they know that only one hundred members of the [[Quest|questing party]] had survived to round the shore of the [[Great Sea]] and light the signal fire they now sailed towards. That, since its lighting, those few survivors had been overtaken by a malignant and unknowable force. That the few of their crew who would return home would do so very much changed and that they were ushering in a time of great darkness for humanity in the City of Gardens.

One dark night six weeks later, the expedition's sole surviving ship was spotted off shore by night watchers in the Stilts. Curiously, no communications were forthcoming by signal lamp, no lights of any kind emanating from within. Nor was there any sign of life visible from shore or by the avian companions of the [[Fisher Queens]] or the [[Messengers Guild]].

This was long before quarantine law had been instituted by the Court – and was in fact the event that inspired such protocols – and so the ghost ship was towed back to dock in the Shipwrights Quarter that very night. The night was dark and it was late enough that the sighting of the ship did not attract passersby hoping to witness the historic return of House Lightbringer from their quest. Instead, the ship glided over the waves without a sound, passing by a fleet of newly constructed Guild vessels docked there and waiting to be of use.

Once docked, a small party of mostly Guild representatives, Fisher Queens, and a nearby patrol of [[Silver Wolves]] embarked the ghost ship. First they searched the top deck – lit only by their lanterns and the oscillating light of the [[Elven Signaltower]] and its [[nyxfire]] flame – but, as reported, there were no signs of life. A number of [[Oklop]] were called to mount the hull and scuttered from porthole to porthole, but none of the crew were found.

Sending two messengers to relay the news and find others to join them, the party began their descent into the lower decks of the ghost ship. Still, they came across no living crew, nor did they find their remains or any sign of a struggle that might explain what had happened here. More, the shadows here seemed impossibly black, thick and substantial and far away from the light of [[Ylem]].

It was there in the [[extramundane]] darkness of the [[benighted]] lower decks that the pertinent questions began presenting themselves to the search party. Where was the ship's crew and what had happened to them? Had they indeed reached the source of the signal to the east and why had only this ship returned? What exactly were they dealing with here?

It was just as they searched the final cabin below decks and considered returning back above deck that they came across them. As soon as they were revealed by the light of the party's lanterns, they let out a guttural, animal roar and darted past them with an unimaginable speed. That brief flash revealed a frightening image: two large beasts whose powerful, crimson musculature was not covered by skin or hide or coat. In the dark of that much benighted place, they appeared as something out of one's nightmares.

By the time the search party turned around, the two red flashes had nearly reached the upper deck, violently bursting through the annals of the ship and splintering the doorframes on their way out. And by the time they reached above decks themselves, the beasts were nowhere to be seen.

Such was the arrival of the [[Red Court]] in the City of Gardens which ushered in the [[Red Death period]]. Warded away from the Elven Signaltower by its flame of pure nyxfire, the desperate [[near-life]] beasts fled to the outskirts of the City where the threat they posed and the [[Red Death]] they carried would fester. In the months to come, humanity would suffer such devastation that – even in this [[Crisis of Hubris]] characterized by loss after devastating loss – both past and future of not only Omphalos, the City of Gardens but of the entire [[Known World]] would be changed forever.
