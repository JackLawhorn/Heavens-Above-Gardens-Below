The Silver Wolves led [[Clan Wolfstepper]] to become one of the original great [[human clans]] along the [[Elven March]] and one of the original four [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the [[Court]]. Until their [[Fallen Houses|fall]], which ended the [[Crisis of Hubris]] and brought about the [[Renascence]], they were among the greatest leaders of humanity in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

## Role within human society

In general, the Silver Wolves were seen as demigods among [[cland]] humanity, second only to the [[Elven Legion|Elves]] themselves. They were the first to grasp magics of their own, and were as children of the [[Nyx]] itself through their [[Pact magics|pact]] with their [[iconic pacts|patron]] [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]], the [[Wolf Mother]].

### Protectors of the pack

Proficient warriors, hunters, and night watchers, the Silver Wolves quickly fell into the role of humanity's protectors, especially after the founding of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] after which the [[Sun Elves]] continued on their march without the humans.

Along the [[Elven March]], they protected the rear and the flank, protecting the weak from raiding [[goblins]] from the east and from [[Aká»¥m]] marauders attacking from the coast to the west. Later, in the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]], they patrolled the streets and the rooftops. Always in squads of three, generally taking a mix of human and wolf forms, the sight of them reassured a vulnerable humanity that greater powers were watching over them.

After the founding of the [[Court]], [[Clan Wolfstepper]] would be among the first to be granted [[Great House|Great Houseship]].

### Keepers of silver

Closely tied with raw silver as the [[docetic]] form of their patron, the [[Lunar Aspects#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]], the Silver Wolves were the sworn keepers of the metal. Mining and working it themselves, it was turned into powerful arms and armor capable of slaying [[extramundane]] and [[benighted]] foes with ease and adapting to both their human and wolf forms.
