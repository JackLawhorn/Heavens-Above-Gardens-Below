Early humanity, sometimes referred to as [[cland]] humanity, was structured into hundreds or perhaps thousands of human clans during the [[Elven March|Elven March period]]. The small, isolated communities of prehistory came together as they followed the [[Sun Elves]], mixing, merging, and splitting their cland heritage over the course of untold generations.

## Influence of the Elves

[[Cland]] humanity was greatly influenced by the Elves, having first believed them to be gods themselves upon [[Nyxfall of the Elven Legion|their nyxfall]]. Cland life was largely non-gendered, with the concepts of sex and gender themselves considered a kind of weakness or fault the Elves did not possess. The human clans also naturally valued combat prowess as well as the Elven combat sports. To this day, the history of nearly every human sport can be traced back to these games.

One prominent impact that the [[Sun Elves]] had on early humanity was an understanding of power. Born without [[organic magics]] of their own, humans were magically inferior to the Elves as well as being physically inferior. Faced with a hostile world and their own vulnerability, they sought power of their own through [[Pact magics]]. Some found power through the forming of [[Iconic pacts]] with the many [[Aspect|Aspects of Ylem]] that exist within the [[Known World]], while others instead formed [[Mutualist pacts]] with races of the [[Noble beasts]].

Effectively wards of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]], humans were able to leverage this closeness to form bonds with other peoples, especially the [[Lunar Aspects]] and the noble beasts.

## Prominent clans

Over the centuries, certain clans rose in prominence, usually due to gaining power and magics of their own or due to a unique relationship with the Elves.

### Clan Lightbringer

The Clan Lightbringer arose from those humans who followed closest behind the Elves at the front of the [[Elven March]]. There they absorbed Elven combat techniques and reverence towards battle, leading them to become the greatest human warriors using mundane ability alone.

Even without the [[Sun Elves#Organic magics of the Sun Elves|organic magics of the Sun Elves]], they were so dedicated to the keeping of the light that they took it upon themselves to provide fire to all of humanity behind them in the march. Through this dedication, their bond with the elemental [[Nyxfire motes]] grew strong. Though not able to summon [[nyxfire]] flames as the [[Sun Elves]] could, after generations they did in fact become able to ignite the smallest of sparks.

After the [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founding]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and the [[Court]] in the later [[Heliotropic Age]], Clan Lightbringer would not only gain [[House|Houseship]] but would be the first [[Great House]] as well.

### Clan Wolfstepper

> For more, see [[Clan Wolfstepper]].

[[Clan Wolfstepper]] rose from the members of a great many other clans who, [[Birth of the Silver Wolves|moonlit night]], heard the call of the [[Lunar Aspects#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]] – the [[silver moon]], daughter of the [[Nyx]]. Having been accepted into her pack, they became as wolves themselves, walking as demigods among the rest of [[cland]] humanity and second only to the Elves themselves.

As the [[Sun Elves]] took responsibility over the protection of humanity, so too did the [[Silver Wolves]] become the protectors of their more vulnerable kin. Able to take the form of wolves and wielding arms and armor of pure silver – chunks of their patron come crashing down to the [[Known World]] – they were fierce fighters, trackers, and hunters.

### The Rookish Clans

A great many clans formed bonds with the many avian races of the [[Noble beasts]], coming to be known as the [[Rookish clans]]. From these companions, the Rooks learned a great many things. The form of their beaks and feathers inspired the invention of arrows, throwing knives, cloaks, and feather scale armor – all distinct from any Elven equipment or [[Combat Arts]].

They are cloaked rangers with an arsenal of ranged, thrown, and short bladed weapons who quickly became some of humanity's most proficient hunters, albeit after the [[Silver Wolves]]. Many even learned an almost [[extramundane]] proficiency in climbing from the [[Sun Elves]] to better mimic and complement the hunting patterns of their companions.

From their ranks came the [[Messengers Guild]] and the [[Fisher Barons]] and their [[Barony of Stilts]].
