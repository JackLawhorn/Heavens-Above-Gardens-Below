The Duchy of Stilts is a coastal district on the southern shore of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and that has grown along the [[Sun Coast]]. Standing on stilt-like wooden pilings above the tides of the [[Sink]], it is a major hub of commerce and transportation for not only the City but the [[Known World]]. Founded and controlled by the [[Fisher Queens]], it is also home to a number of other factions.

## History of the Duchy

Built in the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]] by the [[Fisher Queens]], the [[Architects Guild]], and the [[Shipwrights Guild]], the Stilts was one of the first major construction projects underwent after the fall of the [[Oremongers Guild]]. At first jokingly named the "Duchy of Stilts" as it was being built, it quickly became an influential [[City districts|City district]].

During the [[Red Death period]], the citizenry would flock towards the base of the [[Elven Signaltower]] and its [[nyxfire]] flame for protection. They concentrated within the [[White Quarter]] and the Duchy of Stilts – easily defendable due to its proximity to both the Signaltower and the water. The scars of this mass arrival can still be seen in the Stilts today, in the low-class, densely-populated neighborhood known as the [[#Shoals]].

After the great [[Burning]] and in the [[Reconstruction]] that followed, the Stilts would already be the hub of the fishing industry, providing the majority of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s food supply. It would grow to be home to many other [[Houses of Industry]], including the Shipwrights Guild who helped construct it and the aquatic farming industry. It has also become a major port of trade, travel, and culture, being a gateway into the City's culture, economy, and [[Court]] for the many aquatic [[Discoveries in the Known World#Noble beasts|noble beasts]] and races of the [[Orior]].

## Layout and sub-districts

The Duchy is the most densely packed district of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], comprising several distinct sub-districts in an area roughly the size of the [[Old City]]'s [[White Quarter]] which it neighbors.

The Duchy's titular stilts are a stride wide in diameter, and ranging from 15 to 50 strides long. They anchor the platforms, bridges, and structures that comprise the Duchy in their place above the waves of the [[Sink]] – suspended 3-to-7 strides above the water depending on depth, time of day, and season. This tidal range is considered micro-tidal, far less than that seen farther from the center of the [[Known World]].

### Shoals

This low-class, densely-populated neighborhood is stacked vertically – built both above the boardwalk-like platforms and below amongst and between the stilts – and is interconnected by bridges and walkways. These structures are generally in poor condition, having been built long ago in the [[Red Death period]] and in a state of emergency, but the people of the Shoals are hardy and handy and self-sustaining.

The Shoals is in fact so dense that it has grown outward from the border of the Stilts themselves: a vast village of passenger, fishing, and house boats. Some are scuttled and permanently anchored in place, similarly connected via crude plank walkways, while others are still seaworthy and can be taken out by their owners.

### Embassy Quarter

The Duchy of Stilts is a major port of trade, travel, and culture, being a gateway into the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s culture, economy, and [[Court]] for the many aquatic [[Discoveries in the Known World#noble beasts|noble beasts]] and races of the [[Orior]]. Their [[Consulates of the Orior|Consulates]] make up the Duchy's Embassy Quarter, a major hub of power for the Consulates of the Orior as a political entity. It is positioned around the shore of the [[Great Sea]], closer to land than much of the greater Duchy.

### Great Sea Bazaar

One of the defining features of the [[#Embassy Quarter]] is the Great Sea Bazaar, a massive open-air market and the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s first. It was founded by the [[Oklop|Oklop consortium]] of the [[Sun Coast]], who desire humanity's many trinkets and bobbles, but has grown to include the wares of other races of the [[Orior]], the [[Fisher Queens]]' fishmongers, and aquatic produce.

### Shipwrights Quarter

The headquarters of the [[Shipwrights Guild]], this quarter is where humanity's ships and floating platforms are constructed and sold, as well as where many of the citizenry dock their own vessels. Expert builders and some of the original constructors of the Duchy of Stilts itself, they more or less control its continued growth to grow their territory as wanted or needed.
