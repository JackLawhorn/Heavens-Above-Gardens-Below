Across the treacherous waves of the [[Sink]], the isles of the [[Great Sea]] represent great opportunity for a humanity that – as early as the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] – began to reach outside of the [[Walls and gates of the City|walls]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and towards the rest of the [[Known World]]. Some have been settled but the [[Remnants of the Fallen Houses|remnants]] of the [[Fallen Houses|fallen]] [[Great House|Great Houses]], some lay uninhabited or uninhabitable, and others are home to strange peoples the likes of which have never been seen by human eyes.

## Transportation, exploration, and development

The human settlements built upon the isles of the [[Great Sea]] are accessible and kept alive only by the [[Sink]]-faring vessels and shipping routes of the [[Shipwrights Guild]]. The Guild came to prominence in the [[Red Death period]] – during which the [[Barony of Stilts]] they helped architect served as safe haven from the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] – and in the Reconstruction that came afterward. But the [[expansion of the Republic|expansion]] of what would become the [[Republic]] throughout the [[Renascence]] would catapult them to heights not seen even by several [[Great House|Great Houses]].

The Shipwrights Guild is paramount at every stage of a settlement's lifecycle. It was [[Shipwrights Guild#Guild navigators|Guild navigators]] that charted the Great Sea in the [[Early Renascence period]], their [[Shipwrights Guild#Guild quartermasters|quartermasters]] who compiled the resources for each [[Questing Charter]], and their Sink-faring vessels that transported the settlers and their supplies to their destination. Once a [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colony]] is established, Guild shipping routes are set to bring life-giving resources in and take trade goods and other riches out. These routes connect the isles of the Great Sea to each other, to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], and to the rest of the Republic.

## Prominent locations on the Great Sea

### The Isle of Melos

> For more, see [[Isle of Melos]].

The [[Isle of Melos]] was the first isle of the [[Great Sea]] to be settled by humanity and is the oldest surviving human settlement outside of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Founded by the [[Fall of the Materialists College#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exiled]] [[necromancer demons]] of the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fallen]] [[Materialists College]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], it remains their base of operations but has also grown into a thriving [[#trade port]] thanks to its valuable resources and continued relationships with the [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] of the [[Questing Houses]].

### The Isle of Talos

> For more, see [[Isle of Talos]].

The [[Isle of Talos]] is a small isle of the [[Great Sea]] and the second to be settled by humanity – specifically, the predecessors of [[House Talos]] before its founding who came there to escape the ramifications of their connections to the [[First Vergonic Church]] during the [[Vergonic War]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. It is best known as the origin of the [[simulacra]], which have developed entire cultures within its gardens.

### The Wailing Stacks

> For more, see [[Wailing Stacks]].

The [[Wailing Stacks]] are a closely co-located collection of sea stacks and home to the [[banshees]], [[Minor Aspects]] and children of the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind]] and [[Mundial Aspects#water motes|water motes]]. Far from any welcoming shore or isle, the stacks stick straight up out of the [[Sink]] – their rocky, vertical cliff faces pockmarked with caves and extending up into the very sky. Between the stacks are a network of claustrophobic channels that goad the waves of the [[Great Sea]] into a frenzy of crashing, eroding movement and the wind into a sonic phenomenon that gives them their name. Depending on the day and the weather and the whims of the banshees, this sound might sound like mournful cries, the howling of beasts, or even seductive calls from some unknown caller.

### The Bleached Cay

> For more, see [[Bleached Cay]].

The [[Bleached Cay]] is less an isle than a low bank of dead coral matter that was once a living community of beings similar in nature and composition to the [[Reef Knights]] of the [[Sink]]. Protruding just barely above the waves of the [[Great Sea]] and exposed to the harsh light of [[Ylem]] against which they had no defense, what remains are their bleached white and stone-like remains. The Cay is treacherous terrain for any traveler – layer upon razor sharp layer built upon each other – and it is thought to be not only uninhabited but entirely uninhabitable.
