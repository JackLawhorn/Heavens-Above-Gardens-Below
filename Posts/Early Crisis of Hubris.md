There is some contention between the historians of the [[House of the Sun]] and the [[Scholars of the City#Subjectivists|Subjectivist scholars]] of the City over the most appropriate start to the Crisis of Hubris. It is understood as beginning sometime between the [[Mines of the Oremongers Guild|mining operations]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] in what is now [[The Maw]] and [[House Lightbringer]]'s arguing for their doomed [[Questing Charter]] before the Court.

The point at which the Early Crisis of Hubris ends sees no such contention, however: it was the day that the vessel of the [[Shipwrights Guild]] arrived back in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and brought with it the [[Red Court]] and its [[Red Death|plague]].

## Vulnerability

The [[Crisis of Hubris]], and especially the Early Crisis of Hubris, are characterized by significant losses that revealed how truly vulnerable humanity was within the walls of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. First, the [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] who were the greatest fighting force in all of the [[Known World]]. Then, the [[Fall of House Lightbringer|fall]] of [[House Lightbringer]] who were humanity's greatest leaders after the [[Sun Elves]] themselves.

During [[Reconstruction]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and into the [[Early Renascence period]], human historians would come to understand that it was the latter of these downfalls that brought the [[Red Court]] and its [[Red Death|plague]] to the City. With their defensive and leadership abilities so significantly reduced, the [[Red Death period]] to come would further devastate a now especially vulnerable humanity.

## The Barony of Stilts and the Shipwrights Guild

The Early Crisis of Hubris saw significant advances by the water faring [[House|Houses]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] which enabled humanity within its walls to more effectively life off of and traverse the treacherous waves of the [[Sink]]. Most prominent were the construction of the [[Barony of Stilts]] by the [[Fisher Barons]] and the founding of the [[Shipwrights Guild]].

These Houses would play a significant role in the [[Red Death period]] to come. The Guild, in seeking to retrieve the surviving members of [[House Lightbringer]]'s [[quest|questing party]], instead brought back with them the [[Red Court]] and its [[Red Death|plague]]. With the City besieged by these horrors, much of its populace retreated to the relative safety of the Barony.

## Objectivism and humanism

The [[History of the Subjective#Late Heliotropic Objectivism|Late Heliotropic Objectivism]] of the last [[Ages of the Known World|age]] continued to flourish throughout much of the Early Crisis of Hubris. The [[Scholars of the City|scholars]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] sought complete understanding of the [[Known World]] and beyond.

After the the [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]], whose [[iconic pacts|iconic magics]] rose up the entirety of the [[Old City]] with little more than a thought, humanity was now forced to learn a mundane approach to architecture and construction. These efforts are often cited as the first [[Humanism|humanist]] [[Great Works]], relying on human understanding and ability rather than on [[extramundane]] power and abilities.

By the end of this period and into the [[Red Death period]], this predilection towards [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivism]] in scholarship, philosophy, and the arts would give way to [[History of the Subjective#Second Wave Henotheism|Second Wave Henotheism]] and later [[History of the Subjective#Subjectivism|Subjectivism]].
