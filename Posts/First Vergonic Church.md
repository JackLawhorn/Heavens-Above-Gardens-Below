The First Vergonic Church was a [[Scholars of the City#Subjectivists|Subjectivist]] thought experiment that branched off from the [[Philosophers Guild]] in the [[Early Renascence period]] to become a prominent artistic and philosophical movement and a driving force in the matters of the [[Court]] for over a century. Today, it is best remembered for its spiritual successor – the [[New Vergonic Movement]] – and the [[Vergonic War]] that it brought about in the streets of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Scholars Quarter]].

## History of the First Vergonic Church

### Founding of the Church

The First Vergonic Church was born out of the [[History of the Subjective#Second Wave Henotheism|Second Wave Henotheism]] of the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and is largely considered today to have been a rebellion by the [[scholars of the City]] against the [[History of the Subjective#Renascence Objectivism|Objectivism]] that the [[Renascence]] would come to be known for. The Church was a thought experiment led by the [[Scholars of the City#Subjectivists|Subjectivists]] of the [[Philosophers Guild]] who viewed their scholarly [[quest]] for understanding as something akin to the worship of [[Ylem]] and its [[Aspect|Aspects]]. Just as the [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivists]] of the [[Cult of Pythos]] had pursued understanding of Form in exploration of the shape of the [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Spheres]] and the [[Laws of Power]] themselves, the Church would – in a more allegorical sense – work to map [[the Subjective]] itself.

### Rise to prominence

The Subjectivists quickly rose to prominence in the halls of the [[Court]]. They developed the first actively political works, seeking to communicate and persuade political ideals. The First Vergonic Church's philosophies on life, politics, the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]], and her [[Social Spheres Theory|Social Spheres]] would go on to have profound impact on any number of matters of the Court. Many [[House|Houses]] saw their power wax and wane by the hand of the Church.

For one hundred years it boasted among its members the [[Scholars of the City#Subjectivists|Subjectivist scholars of the City]], [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] and their cabinets, and even a number of [[Orator|Orators]]. They spoke and held debate in the auditoriums of the [[Philosophers Guild]], gathered in the streets and in the [[rayas]] of the City, and bloviated and filibustered in Court.

Among their detractors were the [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivists]] factions of the [[Scholars Quarter]] and the [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]]. Of all the scholarly factions, few other than the [[Psionics College]] and the [[Philosophers Guild]] that the Church branched off from established a presence for themselves in the controversy. The [[House of the Sun]] also had noticeable friction with the Church – at least when its acting Orator wasn't a member herself that is.

### The fall of the Church

The First Vergonic Church fell not with a bang as humanity's [[Great House|Great Houses]] had throughout the [[Crisis of Hubris]] but with a whimper. In the end, the Church's [[History of the Subjective#Subjectivism|Subjectivist movement]] did not have sufficient staying power, or perhaps simply could not compete with its rival and the predominant movement of the [[Ages of the Known World|age]]: [[History of the Subjective#Renascence Objectivism|Renascence Objectivism]]. Where the former brought about greater political thought and activism in the populace of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] – a legacy that is visible even now in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]] – the latter developed new [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivist]] art techniques such as perspective that the [[Renascence]] would come to be known for.

## The Vergonic thought experiment

The cosmology of the First Vergonic Church's thought experiment was strictly allegorical – despite the concerns and accusations levied against them by the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]]. The concepts of [[#Truth and Untruth]] and of the [[#the Muses|Muses]] was expressly conceived of for the purposes of inspiring creative expression in the same way that worship of the [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]] had inspired artistic movements for all of recorded human history.

It was thought that in doing so, explorations of [[the Subjective]] could get at truths of the human experience just as the [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivist]] [[Great Works]] of the [[Cult of Pythos]] had mapped the divine geometry of the [[Nyx]] itself. Such [[humanism|humanist]] ideals were at the heart of the First Vergonic Church and would gain much traction with [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its populace throughout the [[Renascence]].

### Truth and Untruth

Under this thought experiment, the atomic components of the [[Nyx]] were reframed as *Truth* and *Untruth* rather than the reality of [[Ylem]] and the unreality of the [[Dragon]]. Controversially, this reframing did not strictly map the divinity of Ylem directly to Truth and the Dragon to Untruth. Rather, divinity was defined as that which revealed Truth where the [[Aspect|Aspects]] and even the [[Angels]] themselves were known to obscure or bend Truth when this suited their own agendas.

Truth and Untruth were defined as universal constants, but could not be measured by [[the Objective|Objectivist]] means. One could see Truth without recognizing it, and could recognize it without understanding it. Untruth was all around, a force against which Truth could never achieve victory on a macroscopic scale. There were agents, both benign and malignant, who played the role of *Deceiver* and led our understanding further from Truth. But to deceive was not evil but neutral, the natural state of reality and of human experience.

### The Muses

In the First Vergonic Church's thought experiment, the Muses were divine agents most comparable to the [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]] who revealed Truth or the path to it. For the [[Scholars of the City#Subjectivists|Subjectivists]] of the Church, this meant inspiration in the realms of the arts and philosophy, and the creation of works that – while not described by [[the Objective]] – aspired to the [[humanism|humanist]] ideals of the [[Politics of the Scholars Quarter#The Vergonic Movements|Movement]].

Like the rest of the thought experiment, the Muses were entirely allegorical yet would go on to inspire Subjectivists even now in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]]. It is especially common for the bards of the [[Mouseion]] to adorn their workshops and the stages of their epics with iconography of Muse-like figures. Over time, many characters both throughout history and in works of fiction have been portrayed as fulfilling this persona and the more zealous of the Subjectivists even subscribe to some as one would a [[Iconic pacts|patron]] Aspect.

### The traveler and the labyrinth

One enduring piece of iconic imagery from the First Vergonic Church is that of the traveler and the labyrinth:

> *A traveler journeys through the labyrinth on their journey towards Truth, though they may not recognize the labyrinth around them nor the destination they journey towards. Companions join and walk beside them, take their leave and make their own way towards Truth. Signs of fellow travelers can occasionally be seen over the walls of the twisting and turning pathways, tall standards bobbing up and down. It is unknown if either the traveler's companions or the standard bearers are closer to Truth or further away from it, whether they play the role of Muse or Deceiver. It is unknown what role the traveler themselves play in the journeys of the others.*

## Legacy of the First Vergonic Church

The First Vergonic Church represented the first major [[Scholars of the City#Subjectivists|Subjectivist]] movement since [[Politics of the Scholars Quarter#The Schism|the Schism]] of the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]]. Although it ultimately failed to capture the hearts and minds of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its populace with the sort of lasting influence that [[History of the Subjective#Renascence Objectivism|Renascence Objectivism]] possessed, its legacy is still felt in the works of the [[Mouseion]] and in the lectures and debates of the [[Philosophers Guild]].

Its greatest lasting impact on human scholarship has perhaps been the [[Social Spheres Theory]], which reframed the [[Social Spheres Theory#Social spheres of the Elven Legion|social spheres]] of [[Elven culture|Elven society]] to describe the human experience. Even now, in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], the goings on of the City are understood through the lens of the Spheres of [[Social Spheres Theory#Sphere of Politics|Politics]], [[Social Spheres Theory#Sphere of Knowledge|Knowledge]], [[Social Spheres Theory#Sphere of Industry|Industry]], [[Social Spheres Theory#Sphere of Worship|Worship]], and [[Social Spheres Theory#Sphere of the Subjective|the Subjective]] – as well as a number of [[Social Spheres Theory#Secondary Spheres|secondary Spheres]].

### The New Vergonic Movement and the Vergonic War

Of course the most significant impact of the First Vergonic Church was the [[New Vergonic Movement]] that came after it and the [[Vergonic War]] that it brought to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Scholars Quarter]].
