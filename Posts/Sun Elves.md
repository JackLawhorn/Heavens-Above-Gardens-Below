The Sun Elves are the ground infantry of the [[Elven Legion]], masters of hand-to-hand combat and soldiers of the [[Kingdom of Heaven]]. Upon the [[nyxfall of the Elven Legion|nyxfall of the Legion]], they formed a bond with early humanity, taking on responsibility for their protection and development.

## The March

The March is nearly synonymous with the nomadic Sun Elves, deeply impacting their entire society, culture, and way of life. [[Nyxfarer|Nyxfarers]] by nature, they march across the [[Nyx]] and from world to world with the rest of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]]. The March is the primary mechanic by which they contribute to the [[roiling of the Nyx]] – the eternal conflict between the [[Angels]] and the [[Glossary/Dragon]] – by reclaiming [[fallen world|fallen worlds]].

Their contribution to this divine quest is to tame the [[Wild Magics]] and their [[nyxfire]] storms, returning order to the magics and to these worlds. The theaters of the [[Storm Elves]] and the [[Sea Elves]] above and below respectively, have their own missions that are similar but largely considered irrelevant to the lives of the Sun Elves.

Secondarily, the March works to find and develop the other races of the [[Orior]] on these worlds. Contact with the Elves and proliferation of the [[Organic magics of the Elven Legion#The Elven tongue|Elven tongue]] was long believed to play some unknown role in the evolution and exultation of the Orior, although more recent peoples such as the [[Procyon gaze]] are found to have developed without this influence.

## Organic magics of the Sun Elves

> The magics described here are specific to the Sun Elves, who are but one faction of their race. For a general overview of the magics that are shared by the [[Elven Legion]] as a whole share, see [[Organic magics of the Elven Legion]].

Like the [[Storm Elves]] and their bolts, [[organic magics]] of the Sun Elves allow them to wield [[nyxfire]] flames. These magics manifest in a number of different ways:
- A certain influence with and over the elemental [[nyxfire motes]]
- The summoning of flames to be wielded in combat
- The taming of the [[Wild Magics]] and their nyxfire storms
