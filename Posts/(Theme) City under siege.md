In exploring a city under siege from an enemy force, we naturally end up pushing the urban sprawl to its extreme. The population is confined within its bounds, with the area outside those bounds – as well as certain areas within the city itself – controlled by the enemy or some other antagonistic and harmful force. Without outside help or access to necessary supplies and allies, both the population and the reader are made to zoom into this specific part of the world. The opportunities found here, as well as the limitations of this environment, become very clear. What does a war found on streets and from rooftops look like? In our case, how does this environment play with light and shadow, crucial aspects of the battles against this particular enemy?

We can also treat the City as a microcosm of war, where territory is gained and lost in battles or by retreat. Soldiers as well as generals rise and fall, making decisions that shape these borders going forward and which may last even after the war is over. This works to segment the urban environment into districts and quarters and neighborhoods which may or may not have existed previously. These areas come to be characterized by these events, gaining more densely packed histories and identities of their own.

In my work on [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[Red Death period]] and humanity's [[Campaigns against the Red Court|campaigns]] against the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] have a profound impact on this setting. The [[Old City]] – essentially all that existed of the City before this time – is split in two: the [[White Quarter]] and the [[Red Quarter]]. Additionally, the [[Duchy of Stilts]], which was previously home only to the [[Fisher Queens]], the [[Shipwrights Guild]], and other water-centric factions, is suddenly thrust into a much more significant role for the population and itself is reshaped by these events.
