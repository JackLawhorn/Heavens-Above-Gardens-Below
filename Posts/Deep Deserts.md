The Deep Deserts are an arid region at the northernmost reaches of the [[Old World continent]] and of the [[Known World]]. This place was so warped by the [[nyxfire]] of the [[Wild Magics]] in [[prehistory]] that their sands have fused into crystalline formations and that the influence of the [[Laws of Power]] themselves is limited here.

## Geography

The Deep Deserts are a region with a unique geography all their own. Though there exist other deserts in the [[Beastlands]] to the south of the [[Old World continent]], this area is overwhelmingly comprised of sand and lacking areas of dirt and even scrub vegetation.

To the south lies the rest of the [[Valley of Ruins]] and the rest of the Old World continent, and to the west the desert becomes more coastal until it reaches the [[Gold Coast]] and the [[Sink]]. Like the rest of the continent, the east is still steeped in the [[Astral Wilds]] forming a natural barrier for races of the [[Orior]] and the [[noble beasts]] alike.

### Vitrum formations

One of the more iconic sights of the Deep Deserts are the large glass formations called vitra (singular "vitrum"), formed by the superheating of sand by the pure [[nyxfire]] of the [[Wild Magics]]. Their glass is strikingly transparent, though sometimes forming lenses which warp the light in such a way that they effectively hide objects sitting directly behind it.

The razor sharp vitra extend out of the dunes – sometimes several storeys tall – and may start just as deep below. Many are singular, blade-like formations jutting out at an angle. Others are grouped in clusters, forming canyon-like networks. For the natives of the Deep Deserts, the vitra are a key part of their ecosystem. They can be used to elude predators, protect from the elements, and the shapes of some even collect what little moisture is in the air here.

### Psicrystal columns

Another iconic feature of the Deep Deserts are the massive psicrystal columns, which extend out of the sands similar to the [[#vitrum formations]]. Unlike the vitra, the columns extend straight up and are massive, commonly several hundred strides in circumference. Their size and the striking pink color of the [[docetic materials#psicrystal|psicrystal]] makes them visible from days around.

Three unique columns have been found, but there may be more. Their origin is not known with any certainty, but it is thought that they are tied to the [[#mirage|mirages]] as psicrystal is tied to [[Psionics#psionic influence|psionic influence]] and the [[Psionic Sphere]].

### Mirage

To the north, the Deep Deserts do not end so much as the [[Known World]] itself fades away. Here, scars called mirages are left behind by extreme exposure to the [[nyxfire]] of the [[Wild Magics]] in prehistory. The mirages are gaps in the domains of the [[Laws of Power]], where the physical reality of the [[Prime Material Sphere]] gives way to the [[extra-physical]] [[Psionic Sphere]].

This anomaly is the cause of countless, strange phenomena in the Deep Deserts. Famously, the [[Pretender]] foresaw a future for humanity within the frontier of these mirages, led their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] on a [[Questing Charter of the Pretender|religious pilgrimage]] to reach them, and [[Fall of the Pretender|fell]] attempting to cross through them and into the Psionic Sphere.

## Natives of the Deep Deserts

With very little moisture or vegetation to speak of, native species and peoples of the Deep Deserts are far and few between. Those who remain possess unique adaptations to survive and thrive in this unforgiving environment.

### Muqallid mimics

> For more, see [[Muqallid mimics]].

The mysterious [[Muqallid mimics]] are thought to be native to the Deep Deserts, perhaps even emerging from the [[#mirage|mirages]] themselves. The only naturally-[[Psionics|psionic]] race of the [[Orior]], their insectoid forms are shrouded in a powerful haze of [[Psionics#Hallucination|hallucinations]] and [[psionics#silencing|silencing]]. Their presence slips through gaps in human perception, and they are largely passive wanderers both in and outside of the deserts.

### Ekhinos

The Ekhinos are a complete taxonomical family of strange plant species, some of the only vegetation in all of the Deep Deserts. They are characterized by needle-like, protruding spines and flesh that is able to store large amounts of moisture. Ekhinos barrels in particular have large circular bodies which flower and produce fruit and provide much needed water to the peoples of the region. It is common to see human travelers through the Deep Deserts with these barrels tied to their belts or worn as packs.

But there also exist a number of Ekhinos species which more closely resemble fauna. The spiny cat of the Deep Deserts is a quadruped creature covered in the same spines which are used effectively both for offense and for defense. The Ekhinos even have their own order of [[Verdant Knights]], though recorded sightings are far and few between.

## Traversing the Deep Deserts

### Desert mounts

Some creatures native to the Deep Deserts have proven effective mounts and pack animals on long journeys through the region, where many creatures used elsewhere in the [[Known World]] prove ineffective due to the sandy landscape. These include the camels as well as the quick dune-runner lizards. 

### Sandships

Around the [[Later Renascence period]], explorers come to the Deep Deserts to the north in pursuit of the [[Pretender]] and their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] famously tamed the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind motes]] there to pilot sandships over the treacherous dunes of the region.
