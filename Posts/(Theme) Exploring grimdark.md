## Tonal dissonance and shifts

Throughout the [[Crisis of Hubris]] arc, my goal is to suffer the populace of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] through a series of rapid tonal shifts.

Throughout the [[Heliotropic Age]], the [[Known World]] and the greater [[Nyx]] are spoken about as if "noblebright" in tone, indicating that there is a modicum of order and reason to the world and that they events that unfold within it are predestined and have some objective and moral reason behind them. As we enter into the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]], this tone quickly veers towards "nobledark". A series of devastating losses shatter our understanding of humanity's place in that world. The Known World appears darker than we once thought, but the perspectives, approaches, and philosophies of the characters who operate within it are still noble.

The [[Red Death period]], further veers away from that initial understanding and into a "grimdark" tone. Now, not only is the world shown to be a darker place, but that tone has also begun to bleed into the characters themselves. They are beginning to come to an understanding of the true nature of their world and are reacting in kind. Their environment – the stimuli they are forced to react to – is no longer simple, and neither are the choices they have to make to live and survive within it.

### How we can understand these shifts

It's one thing for an author/creator of a world to use tonal shifts like these within the content, but what exactly does this mean for the world itself? I don't think we necessarily need to have a solid answer for this. Just as we have questions, it's natural and realistic for the characters themselves to debate the nature of these changes, what is causing them, and whether it is the world that changes or themselves.

One interpretation can be that proximity to the divinity of [[Ylem]] tangibly changes the nature of the world and a people. Of course things seemed brighter and the world populated with true nobility when the [[human clans]] were following the [[Sun Elves]] along the [[Elven March]]. In contrast, when humanity was left by the [[Elven Legion]] to live in their new home – [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] – the world began to feel darker and more complex and questions began to arise about the veracity of what they had been taught to believe. The [[Red Death period]] represents the culmination of this transition, and it is of course no coincidence that humanity was then at its furthest point from the divinity of Ylem.

Another is quite simply that the world itself did not undergo such changes. The current darkness isn't imagined, but perhaps the brightness of the past was. Humanity's past in the [[Known World]] is so interwoven with their legends and mythology that it is at times unclear if the two are actually any different. Add into the mix a loss of historical evidence and controversy over what is fact, and it becomes entirely plausible that human understanding of ages of old is simply incomplete (even willfully so). After all, a thousand years straight of marching doesn't exactly sound as noblebright as portrayed in some of these materials.

## Properties of grimdark

I think people have a sense of what it means for a world or property to be grimdark, generally centered around the portrayal of dystopian, amoral, and violent characteristics. Adam Roberts points to an anti-Tolkien lack of idealism, worlds where "nobody is honorable and might is right".

Liz Bourke certainly seems to believe something similar, describing the subgenre as embracing "darkness for darkness's sake". But she also speaks to the absolution of moral responsibility not just for the characters, but also for the readers themselves. I do think this points to a deeper, more engaging side of this style of writing.

Roberts also describes a further dimension I'd love to explore, one that expands grimdark such that it can be understood as a re-examination of our own real-world history. Grimdark turns its back on the "more uplifting, [Pre-Raphaelite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Raphaelite "Pre-Raphaelite") visions of idealized medievaliana", instead understanding that the images we hold of the chivalry and nobility in the middle ages are far too idealized. No, in reality good fantasy should stress "how nasty, brutish, short and... dark life back then 'really' was". Our own world, then and now is a "cynical, disillusioned, ultraviolent place".

### Realism

Realism is a necessary part of the grimdark experience. The world in question can be fantastical, but realism creates the stakes that define the subgenre. Part of that realism is that the characters are flawed, that they make mistakes. Dramatic irony exists between characters and that creates potentially devastating misunderstandings.

Because of these flaws, that irony, and those misunderstandings, we can understand that their choices are incredibly complex. With no simple problems and no simple solutions, the morality of our actions become significantly less objective. Moral relativism is always something that's fun to explore, especially around politics which is also a big part of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Court]]. Genevieve Valentine specifically calls out a "dark realism behind... kingdom politics".

### True agency

Although the realism of the situation may sometimes make character agency seem futile, that agency does exist. While the human philosophy of the [[Heliotropic Age]] is bound by the ideas imparted by the [[Sun Elves]] of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]] – that the divine order of the [[Angels]] imparts objective meaning and functional predestination upon their actions – the [[Crisis of Hubris]] reveals the true impact and significance of human choice.

Jared Shurin uses the term "fantasy Protestantism" to describe the subgenre, focusing on character agency as a series of choices between good and evil. Of course, we know – and the characters are beginning to suspect – that there is no objective good and evil. This world is one of moral relativism, and so those choices are more accurately described as between doing what we believe to be right and succumbing to the nihilism that allows us to justify doing what we know to be wrong.

I don't think it's true that villains should always believe themselves to be the hero or doing the right thing. I think that looking at this perverted sense of agency under moral relativism, we can see another form of villainy: that of a character who has fallen into dangerous nihilism, stripped of the pretense of morality, and is now driven by something else. The [[Red King]], formerly known as [[Fall of House Lightbringer|Lord Lightbringer]], is one example through which I hope to explore this philosophical nightmare.

### Nihilism

Nihilism is the third characteristic of this subgenre, and is just as necessary to achieving this intended tone. A big part of this is going to be a certain futility to the efforts of the characters that populate this world. Liz Bourke describes "right action... as either impossible or futile". We've already accepted the former as moral relativism is a part of the intrinsic characteristics of realism and true agency, but what about the latter?

There's certainly an element of futility in the cosmology of the [[Nyx]]: it seems inevitable that the [[Dragon]] will win over the reality of [[Ylem]] and the [[Angels]] one day. But that's true of our own world as well. Does that mean that the micro is just as futile as the macro? This will probably come into play a lot later in this project and it's something I don't exactly have mapped out yet, but that I'm nevertheless excited to explore.
