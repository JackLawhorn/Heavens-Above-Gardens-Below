The so-called "Psionic Age" describes a period in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and the [[Early Renascence period]] when [[psionics]] in the [[Known World]] – first [[Mystic psionics]] as a [[magics in the Known World|field of magics]] and then the [[scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist studies]] of the [[Psionics College]] – was discovered and rapidly rose to prominence.

## Dawn of the Psionic Age

The dawn of the Psionic Age is demarked by the rise of [[Disciples of the Pretender|the Pretender and their Disciples]], which revealed the field of [[psionics]] itself to humanity and to the [[Known World]]. These first psions practiced what is now called [[Mystic psionics]], and ultimately left [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] on [[Questing Charter of the Pretender|religious pilgrimage]] to the [[Deep Deserts]]. There, they fell to the powerful psionic forces of the [[Deep Deserts#Mirage|Mirages]].

Back in the City, the remaining human psions were inspired by this loss to pursue the field as an [[scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist science]]. This new [[scholars of the City|class of scholars]] founded the [[Psionics College]] which, throughout the Psionic Age, rose so much in prominence that they took the place of the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fallen]] [[Materialists College]]. As a result, the remainder of this period saw the exploration of this exciting new frontier: both the field of psionics and the [[Psionic Sphere]] itsel.

## Rise in psionic influence

After the [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revelation]] of the first human [[Psion]] – the [[Pretender]] – [[Psionics#psionic influence|psionic influence]] in the [[Known World]] began to see a rapid rise, particularly in the human population of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. The Pretender boasted the ability to awaken [[Psionics|psionic]] influence and ability in others, and used this gift to grow an army of loyal [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] that soon outnumbered the followers of any one [[Iconic House|heterodoxy]].

After the [[Questing Charter of the Pretender]] was granted, after the newly named [[Great House]] left on their [[Quest into Oblivion]], after [[Fall of the Pretender|their fall]] to the [[Deep Deserts#Mirage|mirages]] of the [[Deep Deserts]], even then there remained the psionic scholars in the City. These scholars were awoken by and learned from the Pretender, but did not subscribe to [[Mystic psionics]]. They would go on to form the [[Psionics College]] which further spread psionic influence among the human population.

Throughout the Psionic Age, the field of psionics itself expanded greatly and the awakening to psionic influence of the human population rose in kind. By the end of the Psionic Age in the [[Early Renascence period]], most of the warrior classes of the [[Jurisweard]] and even many [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] of the [[Court]] are tutored in psionics to a certain degree.
