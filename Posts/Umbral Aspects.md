The Umbral Aspects are the shadow cast on by the divine light of [[Ylem]]. Agents of the [[Dragon]] and children of its [[Vestiges]], they are powerful [[Major Aspects]] with a corruptive influence on the [[Known World]] and its inhabitants.

## Draconic heritage

From the [[Dragon]] itself came two [[Vestiges]]: [[Vestiges#Oblivion|Oblivion]] and [[Vestiges#Entropy|Entropy]]. The Vestiges are pieces of unreality itself severed from the whole by the divine strikes of the [[Angels]], and as such are given name and form. When the Vestiges themselves were struck, they shattered into the Umbral Aspects.

From Oblivion came [[Low Ones|Madness]] and [[Fallen Son|Despair]], and from Entropy came [[Red Court|Hunger]] and [[Anōmalos|Wrath]]. They are pieces of pieces of unreality, [[Aspect|Aspects]] of the Dragon, and a dark corruptive force on the [[Known World]] and on all of the [[Nyx]].

## Effects on the Known World

So potent is the corruptive influence of these Umbral Aspects that they have physical effects on the [[Known World]] both in the [[Prime Material Sphere]] and in the [[Astral Sphere]]. These effects have created a number of flora, fauna, and even entire biomes that are [[benighted]] from the light of [[Ylem]] and thus pose a distinct threat not only to the inhabitants of the Known World but to all of reality.

### Nyxblight

In the presence of an Umbral Aspect, one is sure to find an overgrowth of [[nyxblight]] vines. Impossibly black and covered in piercing thorns, the nyxblight grows not only throughout the [[Known World]] but across the wider [[Nyx]]. It is a blight on reality that grows unchecked and strangles the light of [[Ylem]] itself.

Nyxblight is most closely associated with the Umbral Aspect of [[Red Court|Hunger]], whose great [[Nyxblight Tree]] has been a festering scar upon the Known World since the [[fallen world|fall]] of the [[Old World]].

### Shades and shade motes

The [[Shades]] are an extramundane, [[benighted]] biome that arise in the shadows cast by the harsh light of pure [[nyxfire]]. Here, the magics themselves are warped, and mages may or may not find themselves able to connect to them. They are deep and dark and travelers are prone to succumbing to [[Oblivion]]'s children: [[Low Ones|Madness]] or [[Fallen Son|Despair]].

Here, the shadows themselves become animated and manifest in a form similar to the [[Mundial Aspects]]: the [[shade motes]]. The shade motes, like the flora and fauna that populate the Shades, are not necessarily malicious but have a predilection towards trickery. In the immense darkness of these places, the shade motes summon [[shades motes#phantom flames|phantom flames]] that lure passersby deeper into treacherous woods, swamps, and caves.
