"Mystic psionics" refers to the [[#mystic practices]] popularized by the first human [[psion]], now known only as the [[Pretender]]. As opposed to the [[Scholars of the City#objectivists|objectivist]] approach later adopted by the scholars of the [[Psionics College]], mystic psionics more closely resembles practices performed in worship of the [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]] by the [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]].

## Mystic storytelling

Of all the practices of mystic psionics, their storytelling traditions passed down by the first [[Disciples of the Pretender]] are the most iconic. When not pursuing [[Belief in the Pretender#Quests of the Disciples of the Pretender|their many quests]] handed down by the [[Pretender]] themself, the Disciples would gather large crowds in places of comfort or even on the streets and [[rayas]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and tell tales of the things they and their audience had seen and thought and felt and remembered.

Mystic psions rely heavily upon [[Psionics#Hallucination|illusion]] and [[Psionics#captivation|captivation]] to tell their impossible tales, and they are also known for their legendary smoking habits. Out of the smoke clouds of their pipes and hookahs drift shapes and figures and entire scenes.

## Classes of the mystic psions

### Illusionist

So-called "illusions" – now referred to as [[Psionics#Hallucination|Hallucination]] – are [[Psionics|psionic]] manifestations of false sensory information in the [[Psionic Sphere]], creating beautiful or perhaps horrifying sights, sounds, tastes, and pleasures in the minds of others. At the [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of the [[Psionic Age]], the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] made [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] blossomed with a dizzying array of miraculous illusions.

Mystic [[Psion|psions]] first developed illusion as a [[History of the Subjective#Psionic art|medium of art]], and this use did not necessitate realism or believability of the illusions themselves. Later use cases, however, would put more of an emphasis on creating illusions as convincing as possible. These applications, which are also more popular among the [[Scholars of the City#objectivists|objectivist scholars]] of the [[Psionics College]], are practical for offensive and defensive measures, stealth, and the art it sprang from.

### Psiknight

Trusted [[Psionics|psionic]] warriors appointed by the [[Pretender]] themselves, the first Psiknights were powerful mystic [[Psion|psions]] who wander the [[Psionic Sphere]] pursuing various [[Belief in the Pretender#Quests of the Disciples of the Pretender|quests]]. Some warded away and fought dangerous [[Natives of the Psionic Sphere#Psychoses|psychoses]] affecting the populace of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Others investigated rumors of [[Natives of the Psionic Sphere#Haunts|haunts]] wandering the City at night and helped to guide them back to the [[Psionic Sphere#Kingdom of Memory|Kingdom of Memory]].

Now, long after the [[Fall of the Pretender]], a significant number of the few mystic psions who remain in the [[Known World]] continue this noble heritage. Psiknights are far and few between in the City where mystic psions are accosted by the [[Agents of the Psionics College|agents]] of the [[Psionics College]], but their services are much needed and appreciated by those living in the [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] of the [[Questing Houses]].

### Dwaalstepper

Shortly after the [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revelation]] of the [[Pretender]], the blossoming [[Psionics|psionic]] population discovered a new realm within the [[Psionic Sphere]]: [[Dwaal, the Dreaming State]]. This place governs the dreams of all sentient beings in the [[Prime Material Sphere]], and can be traversed just as a [[psion]] would traverse the [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Sphere]]'s landscape of perceived reality. Those who do so are called *dwaalsteppers*.

At the [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of the [[Psionic Age]], the Pretender's dwaalsteppers were far and few between, but played important roles in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. They found that a number of ailments suffered by humanity stemmed not from anatomy but from phenomena in the Psionic Sphere and especially from the Dwaal. In tackling these ailments, the mystic dwaalsteppers became influential healers for their suffering people.

Traversal of the Dwaal remains relatively rare in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], and has not been deeply explored by the [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist scholars]] of the [[Psionics College]]. Such practices were found in the Psionic Age to be unreliable and inconsistent at best. At worst, they might lead to devastating losses such as those of the [[Dreaming psions]].
