Most infamous for its prevalence in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] throughout the [[Red Death period]], the Red Death has wiped out an untold number of the races of the [[Orior]] and the [[noble beasts]]. Those who are infected are warped from the inside out, becoming accursed beasts who serve the [[Red Court]].

## Spread

The plague called the Red Death is in reality a collection of symptoms imparted by the [[Hexecraft pacts|hex]] of the [[Red Court]], which spreads like a particularly aggressive biological infection. Although symptoms and spread varies greatly between the races of the [[Orior]] and [[noble beasts]], it is possible through a wide range of methods, including through the air as small droplets, contact with faeces and then with the mouth, contact with the skin or mucus membranes, and blood and all other body fluids.

At the point of infection, the hex begins to take over the host's [[Albedo#aura|aura]] – a well of [[Albedo]] that surrounds all living things and connects them to [[Ylem]] through the [[Astral Sphere]] – which is parasitically drained and used against them. [[Extramundane]] in origin and nature, natural defense systems are unable to resist the infection and in some cases are even made to turn against the body. An aggressive internal transformation begins that renders every cell malleable. Spreading like a cancer, the hexed cells tear apart existing organs and build new, parasitic ones.

## Early signs and symptoms

Initial symptoms appear within 2-7 days of infection, beginning with hemorrhages which result in the death of tissue. The infected report a general malaise and experience heavy breathing before the onset of chills, a high fever, muscle cramps, swelling, and aching limbs. The anatomists of the [[Materialists College]] also reported finding inflammation of the spleen in this initial phase.

The next phase is characterized by a cough and extreme fatigue. The infected report gastrointestinal problems and develop black dots called lenticulae that are scattered throughout the body. In many cases, they also see gangrene of the extremities such as toes, fingers, lips, and the tip of the nose.

Finally, the infected experience organ failure, the continuous vomiting of blood, and extreme pain which is caused by the decay and decomposition of the skin. At this point, they become delirious. Ultimately, they experience something that presents as death but is in fact the transition to a [[Near-life]] state. Once the body has been conquered by the [[Hexecraft pacts|hex]], the influence of the [[Red Court]] begins to inflict a number of more sizable transformations fueled by the drained [[Albedo]].

## Continued research

Some believe that especially powerful Apex Vectors may have developed within the walls of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] by the end of the [[Red Death period]], such that the extermination of the infected horde during the great [[Burning]] may not have been complete after all. These hypothetical mutations include resistance to flames and to the light of [[Ylem]], as well as the ability to more effectively camouflage among the uninfected human population.

A number of [[Near-life]] biological samples were kept by the anatomists and burgeoning [[Necromancy|necromancers]] of the [[Materialists College]], found by agents of the [[Court]] after their [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]]. These samples were destroyed by [[House of the Sun]] [[Apotropaics#Torchbearer's Purifier clerics|Purifiers]], but it is unknown if any still exist elsewhere in the City or in the wider [[Known World]].
