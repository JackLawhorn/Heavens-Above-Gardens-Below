## Source and morality of "evil"

As always, I try to start with the source of a power and extrapolate from there. We have an obvious source of "evil" or "demonic" power – the [[Dragon]], who as the opposite of divinity could present almost as a Devil-like figure – but that doesn't feel quite right. Are we trying to paint the Dragon as a moral evil or as a force of unmotivated chaos and destruction?

I've always thought that a moral agent that whispers from the dark is a very engaging idea, something like the serpent in the garden of Eden. The Dragon shouldn't fill that role, so instead I look to its direct descendants, the [[Vestiges]] and the [[Umbral Aspects]]. These entities feel better suited to moral motivation and agency as beings that live within the reality of the [[Nyx]] and have even been aggressed against by the forces of the [[Angels]]. In particular, I think [[Low Ones|Madness]] best aligns with this kind of idea, and many of humanity's bad ideas I attribute to their influence.

But the whispering is nothing more than an initial action that sets things in motion; it has to be human nature itself which brings about that end result. Because of this, you won't find the evil factions drawing power from the celestial agents of evil themselves, simply the idea to bring their actions about through their own will and agency.

## Costs of power

Power has to cost something, and the dark arts have got to cost even more. The [[necromancer demons]] have lost enough to exchange for the massive power they've managed to accrue. They failed over and over again throughout the [[Red Death period]], inspiring new and greater experiments that successfully brought them the power to defend their people from such threats in the future. Then, they were [[Fall of the Materialists College|exiled]] for their troubles, and on the word of the [[Triumph of the Sobek|returned]] [[Sun Elves]] no less. Now, they continue to loss more and more in their pursuits, up to and including their humanity.

I love a physical metaphor for corruption here, and it's the power of the [[necromancer devils]] that give us the opportunity to explore that. The devils take a step beyond the rest of the demons, not just carrying [[Materialist magics|materialist]] artifacts that grant them [[extramundane]] abilities but physically grafting them onto their own anatomy. This gives them an absolutely monstrous visage, just their silhouettes are enough to strike fear into those around them. *Side note: I do hope to explore this effect in [[The devil in the Old City]].*
