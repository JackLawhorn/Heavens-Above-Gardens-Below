The Wayfarers Guild – founded amidst rampant [[Decline of cland culture#Persecution of cland peoples|persecution]] against [[cland]] peoples in the [[Early Renascence period]] – serves as a protective front for the [[human clans]] that remained in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Under the banner of the [[Guild]], these so called "wayfarers" maintain their cultures both individually and in constellated unions, either in the form of settled [[Wayfarer colonies|colonies]] or the ever-traveling [[#Wayfarer caravans|caravans]] for which they are perhaps most well known.

## History of the Wayfarers Guild

Starting with the founding of the [[Court]] in the [[Later Heliotropic Age]], humanity underwent an [[Ages of the Known World|age]]-long [[decline of cland culture]]. By the end of the [[Crisis of Hubris]] – culminating in the [[fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of the [[Silver Wolves]] – society in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] had entirely [[Decline of cland culture#transition to a culture of Houseship|transitioned]] to a culture centered around one's [[House|Houseship]].

With [[Clan Wolfstepper]] sequestered within the walls of the [[Argent Ghetto]], the City's remaining [[cland]] peoples also found themselves facing persecution the likes of which had never been levied against a people other than the [[Remnants of the Fallen Houses|remnants]] of the [[Fallen Houses]] themselves. Disparate clans found themselves without Houseship, without the ability to constellate under the banner of a new House of their own, and therefore without representation in Court to ensure their own freedoms would not be stripped away.

Just as it was becoming clear that the future of the [[Human clans|clans]] may no longer lie in the City, they found an unexpected ally: the [[Shipwrights Guild]]. The [[Guild]]'s services as the engineers of ships for travel over land and sea would enable the human clans to venture far away from the laws of the Court and the persecution they faced now. With the backing of this ally, the clans constellated under the newly founded Wayfarers Guild who would found settlements to the north, eventually spreading across the [[Old World continent]].

## Wayfarer caravans

Equipped with state of the art [[landships]], the wayfarers left [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] in massive caravans, traveling across the frontiers of the [[Old World continent]]. This was the greatest human exodus since the [[Elven March]], and the trails their journey took were trampled and stamped down into the pathways that today crisscross the [[Valley of Ruins]] and indeed much of the continent.

[[Human clans|Clans]] or constellations of clans split off from these caravans and went to either found their own [[Wayfarer colonies|colonies]] or simply continued to travel from landmark to landmark and from settlement to settlement for generations hence. Some groups, in fact, have never settled down and have developed wayfarer cultures of their own.

## Role of the Wayfarers Guild

The role of the wayfarers is largely defined by their independence from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and from its [[Court]].

### Bastion from persecution

The [[Guild]] itself was formed as a political guise behind which the cultures of the [[human clans]] might survive and be shielded from persecution and scrutiny of the [[House|Houses]] of the Court and from the [[House of the Sun]]. In the centuries since, their [[#Wayfarer caravans|caravans]] and [[Wayfarer colonies|colonies]] have served as bastions for all those whose culture faced persecution in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] or in the [[colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] of the [[Questing Houses]]. Here, the taboo practices of the [[witch clans]] and even some of the much hated [[remnants of the Fallen Houses|remnants]] of the [[Fallen Houses]] are able to find a home of their own.

### Settling of the Old World continent

The vast majority of humanity's settlements outside of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] were founded to the north by the wayfarers and their caravans of [[landships]]. These [[wayfarer colonies]] dot the [[Old World continent]] – and especially the [[Valley of Ruins]] – like the stars up in the [[Nyx]] on high.

For the [[Republic]] of the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], these colonies serve as important waystations for a variety of industries, all facilitated by the [[Guild]] in return for their relative freedom from the laws of the [[Court]]. Both humanity's communication and travel networks rely on these waystations – even the [[Psionic Telecommunication Network]] whose many towers were built at these sites. For the [[Houses of Industry]], just sites were also key to the supply chain across the continent.
