Hexecraft [[Pact magics|pacts]] are formed not with others like [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]] or [[mutualist pacts]] are, but with small microorganisms within the body called "[[animalcules]]". Because of this, these pacts are generally unable to impart magics that are as potent as those afforded by other kinds of pacts. Instead they can manipulate smaller components of the body to enable more granular physical transformations.

There are generally two types of hexecraft pacts. First, a mage may form a pact with the animalcules in their own body. Second, a more powerful entity – like an [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] – can bypass the [[Pact magics#consent|consent]] that is necessary to form a pact with another by instead forging one with the smaller components of their physical form.
