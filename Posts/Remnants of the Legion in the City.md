The [[Sun Elves]] – who left humanity behind in the [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|newly founded]] [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] to pursue their [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March|Post-Heliotropic March]] – returned to the City in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], accompanying the [[Triumph of the Sobek|Triumph]] of the [[Sobek]]. For the remainder of the [[Crisis of Hubris]], the City was home to a handful of Sun Elves who served as trusted advisors, agents of political change, leaders of worship, and valued guests of all humanity.

## Elven perspectives on human society

When the [[Sun Elves]] of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]] returned to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], they were quickly exposed to a saturated experiencing of the human art, history, and society they had missed while on their [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March|Post-Heliotropic March]]. It was etched into the walls of the City, wrought from the [[wol stone]] itself by the [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|long-since fallen]] mages of the [[Oremongers Guild]], and displayed in the halls of the [[Mouseion]].

They learned of the significance and devastation of humanity's recent losses which were surely as great as their own loss, the loss of their people who had left this world. They reviled the vulgarity of the [[Court]] and its politics. They were astounded by the beauty of the human arts and the attentiveness with which they sought out truths of [[The Objective|objectivism]] and of [[Philosophers Guild|philosophy]] and of life itself.

Many would go on to leave the City in the months to come, preferring their nomadic lifestyle to the stationary existence of the humans. But others would stay and live out the remainder of their lives among this people who had grown and matured without them.

## Roles of the Elves in Court

The returned [[Sun Elves]], those who remained in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], quickly became a common sight in the [[Court]]. At first, they were curious of this strange human ritual, the oft-chaotic clamoring of the many [[House|Houses]] and their [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] vulgar to their Elven sensibilities. But there was also a spark there. In the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], real change was being brought about in the halls of the Court, the effects of which were very much felt in the City and by its populace.

Not only were they prized [[#Court advisors]], but they also worked to form new bodies and oversee new [[Union|Unions]] to bring about the change they thought necessary in this new home of theirs.

### Court advisors

Slowly, a number of [[Sun Elves]] went from attentive members of the audience – honored guests sitting next to the [[Orator|Orators]] of the remaining [[Great House|Great Houses]] – to active participants in the politics of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. They sat as prized political advisors on the cabinets of the [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]], whose [[House|Houses]] quickly rose in prominence due to their guidance if not their presence alone.

### Advocates for the Consulates

With more and more [[Pilgrimages of the Orior]] bringing new peoples to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] throughout the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], they most prominently acted as advocates of the [[Consulates of the Orior]]. They sat and conversed and exchanged ideas not only with the humans but also with the [[Oklop]] and the [[Sobek]], and later with the [[Verdant Knights]] and the [[Reef Knights]]. With their support, the [[Barony of Stilts#Embassy Quarter|Embassy Quarter]] quickly rose up and expanded in the [[Barony of Stilts]] and saw more power in the overwhelmingly human [[Court]].

## Elves and the Silver Wolves

After their [[Triumph of the Sobek|return]] to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[Sun Elves]] took particular interest in the [[Silver Wolves]] just as they had in the [[Elven March]] period. They saw them as the best of humanity, for both their fighting prowess and for their devotion to their [[iconic pacts|patron]] [[Aspect]]. They once again took on a role as mentors and as trainers in their traditional [[Combat Arts]], hoping to arm humanity against new threats like those that had revealed themselves in recent years.

Unbeknownst to the [[House of the Sun]] and the rest of the populace, they would also consult on the state of the [[Lunar Aspects#The Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]] after the devastation of the [[Red Moon]]. They could see that she was weak, and that her magics and influence here in the [[Known World]] was waning. Much of their guidance would go on to inspire what would be [[New Silver Age]].

## Elves and the House of the Sun


Much of the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] – especially as the [[Triumph of the Sobek|returned]] [[Sun Elves]] approached old age – was spent imparting key knowledge and wisdoms to the leaders of humanity. As their [[House of the Sun#Lorekeepers|lorekeepers]], the task of recording this knowledge for perpetuity fell to the [[House of the Sun]] and its [[Orator|Orators]]. All of this information is available in the [[Public Record]], transcribed into ten tomes known as the [[Elven codices]].

They also aided the House of the Sun in establishing and developing what would become the [[State religion]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. As devoted worshippers of [[Nyx]] and of [[Ylem]] themselves, they provided key insights on how to cultivate and promote faith among the population. Many suggested practices, such as mandatory offering of [[teothian religion#teothian sacrifices|teothian sacrifices]], have extended into the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]]. Though controversial with certain [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]] at the time, the state religion is commonly considered to have helped usher in the [[Renascence]].

### The art of astral divination

Of particular importance to the [[Orator|Orators]] of the [[House of the Sun]] was the [[Elven Legion|Elven]] art of [[astral divination]]. Humanity lacked the [[organic magics]] needed to achieve such feats and so the Elven [[Griot|Griots]] spoke on it only scarcely over the years, but even short mentions were transcribed with great interest and in great detail.

In the [[Later Renascence period]] – and in collaboration with the burgeoning [[Engineers Union]] – the [[Office of the Orator]] leveraged these records to create its secret [[orrery]]. This obscure mechanism not only modeled the structure of the [[Nyx]] with great detail, but ultimately enabled to the [[Enlightened Orator]] to read the stars and achieve an artificial form of astral divination.
