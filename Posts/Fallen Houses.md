The Fallen Houses refer to the five [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the [[Court]] who fell over the course of the [[Crisis of Hubris]]: the four original Great Houses and the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] who quickly rose and fell in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]]. To fall means more than to have fallen in prominence in Court or to have disbanded, but connotes a certain gravity and significant impact on humanity and the [[Known World]].

From each Fallen House, humanity has gleaned what are now foundational moral lessons about the world and about human nature. These lessons are canonized by the [[House of the Sun]] and their state religion, and have been explored deeply by the [[Scholars of the City#Subjectvists|subjectivist scholars]] and by the bards of the [[Mouseion]].

The Fallen Houses and accounts of their fall are listed below:
