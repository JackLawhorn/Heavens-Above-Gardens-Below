The [[Disciples of the Pretender]] were the fourth of the [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the [[Court]] to [[Fallen Houses|fall]], lost to the [[Deep Deserts#mirage|mirages]] of the [[Deep Deserts]]. The meteoric rise of this [[cults|cult]] is matched only by their departure from the [[Known World]] and from the [[Prime Material Sphere]] entirely.

## Quest of the Disciples

After successfully debating [[Questing Charter]] before the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]] – and even inadvertently gaining [[Great House|Great Houseship]] as well – the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] left [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] on their [[Questing Charter of the Pretender|religious pilgrimage]]. They trekked north along the [[Gold Coast]] and into the [[Deep Deserts]] at the northernmost reaches of the [[Old World continent]] if not the [[Known World]] itself. There, the [[Pretender]] had gleaned in one of their [[Pretender#Scivias of the Pretender|scivias]], was a place where the [[Prime Material Sphere]] gave way to the [[Psionic Sphere]].

There, according to the accounts of the members of [[Questing Charter of the Pretender#the questing party|their questing party]] who survived to return to the City, the Pretender led their Disciples into the [[Deep Deserts#mirage|mirages]], out of the Prime Material Sphere, and presumably were lost to humanity forever.

## Consequences of the fall

News of the [[Fallen Houses|fall]] of the [[Pretender]] and their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] reached [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] only a year later, a few dozen of the surviving members of the [[Questing Charter of the Pretender#the questing party|questing party]] limping back through the northern gates. In the debriefings performed by the [[House of the Sun]], the details of the [[quest]] into the [[Deep Deserts#mirage|mirages]] of the [[Deep Deserts]] were told and retold and cross-referenced and documented in the [[Public Record|Hall of Public Record]].

The fall of the [[Materialists College]] had proven to humanity that the losses of this [[Ages of the Known World|age]] – what is now called the [[Crisis of Hubris]] – had not ended with the [[Red Death period]], and so the fall of the Pretender and their Disciples was a not-so-surprising development. In fact, it is generally understood that the [[cults|cult]]'s naming as the sixth [[Great House]] of the [[Court]] was primarily motivated by the predictable results of their [[Questing Charter of the Pretender|religious pilgrimage]].

### Moral lessons from the fall of the Pretender

As with all of the [[Fallen Houses]] before them, the fall of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] was made into a canonized moral lesson by the [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the [[Court]] and eternalized by the bards of the [[Mouseion]]. For [[Ages of the Known World|ages]] hence, they have been remembered for the sin of ignorance. The fall of the [[Pretender]] teaches us to reject mysticism and balance belief with understanding. Since then, the study of [[psionics]] as a science rather than a [[Magics in the Known World|field of magics]] has allowed the [[Psionics College]] to rise greatly in prominence.

### The fall of mystic psionics

The [[mystic psionics]] of the [[Pretender]] and their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] was largely abandoned after their fall, giving way to the [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist approach]] of the [[Psionics College]] who pursued [[psionics]] as a field of science. Since, those few pockets of human mystics that remained in the [[Known World]] have dwindled and today – in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]] – there exist only a handful, primary outside of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

Although the Disciples of the Pretender had ushered in the [[Psionic Age]], it did not end with them. The Psionics College would shoulder the burden through the remainder of the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and throughout the [[Early Renascence period]].

### The Canon's Court majority

The [[Disciples of the Pretender]] were the first great threat to the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] and their power in [[Court]]. As a [[Union]] of [[House|Houses]], their long-standing Court majority has impeded the development of [[cults]] that don't receive their sponsorship, but the widespread support given to this up-and-coming faction allowed them to gain Houseship regardless; perhaps the most notable exception. The Canon has gone on to weather the entirety of the [[Renascence]], their majority only beginning to slip now in the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]].
