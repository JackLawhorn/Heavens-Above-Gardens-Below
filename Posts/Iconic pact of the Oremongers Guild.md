## Magics and extramundane abilities

Physically, the [[Iconic pacts|iconic magics]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] functions as a connection between an individual mage and the [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] who govern specific material domains like stone, metals, and even gems. This connection can be called upon with an exertion of will by the mage, which channels [[Albedo]] from their [[Albedo#aura|aura]] through the medium, to the mote or motes, and then back to the mage. The speed of this connection varies greatly based on mundane physical properties of the material itself, as well as the skill of the mage and even willingness of the motes.

Because of this a Guild mage generally specialized in a specific material (also called their "medium"). First came the [[Oremongers Guild#Earth shapers|earth shapers]] who controlled the [[wol stone]] and other such stone media that they found to be plentiful in the gardens upon which the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] was founded, and then their many children who came to specialize in and form a connection with the many gems and metals within the earth. The Guild [[Oremongers Guild#Assayers|assayers]], including the [[jeweler|jewelers]] and the [[aurifaber|aurifabers]] whose media of choice were the precious gems and deposits of gold. The [[Oremongers Guild#Artificer knights|artificer knights]] who commanded the strong, flexible metals of iron and later steel.

### Per-medium sensation

The earliest [[Oremongers Guild#Earth shapers|earth shapers]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] found that during and through the process of connecting with the [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] while commanding their [[iconic pacts|iconic magics]], they were able to access [[extramundane]] sensory data about their surroundings. Minute vibrations within the earth were effective indicators of footsteps and other movements above or below ground. Gaps in stone or packed dirt indicated the presence of other materials, often useful or precious ones that could then be precisely extracted.

This "per-medium" sensation allowed the earth shapers and [[Oremongers Guild#assayers|assayers]] to develop humanity's first mining operations and transform it into their people's largest industry.

### Manipulation and control

Not only did the transfer of [[Albedo]] through a medium allow for [[#per-medium sensation]], but the manipulation of that energy during the process also allowed the [[iconic pacts|iconic mages]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] to command the material itself. As with the speed of this connection, the precision of control varies significantly based on mundane physical properties of the medium, as well as the skill of the mage and even willingness of the motes.

For the [[Oremongers Guild#Earth shapers|earth shapers]], for example, solid stone moved almost like a liquid and could be sculpted easier than wet clay. What this medium lacked in speed and precision of control, it more than made up for in volume of material that could be controlled. Additionally, they found that [[wol stone]] could maintain its solidity for a powerful bludgeoning blow even while moving more like a liquid.

In contrast, the iron and steel were quick, precise, and amazingly flexible, but was more effective when used as a slicing edge or stabbing point as opposed to a blunt, bludgeoning surface. These media made for excellent blades when controlled by the [[Oremongers Guild#artificer knights|artificer knights]], and could be quickly reformed and hardened when returned to the mage so as to serve as effective armor.

Any [[extramundane]] sharpness or hardness of material manipulated this way remained even after the Guild's mages ceased to command it, allowing them to establish themselves as humanity's best armor- and bladesmiths. Of course, after their [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]] these enhancements would be lost near instantly, drastically impacting humanity's various fighting forces.

## The earth motes

Those who came to [[Rise of the Oremongers Guild|form]] the [[Oremongers Guild]] found themselves to possess a particularly strong connection with the [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] in the [[First parley with the elemental motes|very first parley with the elemental motes]] along the [[Elven March]]. Introduced to them by the [[Sun Elves]], who were mentors and advocates of the [[human clans|cland humans]], the earth motes believed not only that these humans had potential as future [[Pact magics|pact-bound]] but also that they could gain much from each other after the [[founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

Indeed, it was not only the [[Oremongers Guild]] that benefitted from this relationship, but also the earth motes who benefitted from the Guild's worship.

### The roiling of the elements

> For more, see [[Roiling of the elements]].

To the [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]], the [[Oremongers Guild]] represented soldiers in their ongoing conflict with the other motes, the remnants of the [[roiling of the elements]] that came after the [[Fallen world|fall]] of the [[Old World]]. The earth motes whose domain included the territory of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] struggled against both the [[Mundial Aspects#water motes|water motes]] and other factions of earth motes delineated by various waterways.

It was imperative to these earth motes that more territory not be ceded to any of these rival factions, and the Guild represented powerful assets in that struggle.

### Onyx

Most important to the [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]] was the [[Oremongers Guild|Guild]]'s service as protectors of the [[polar onyx deposit|polar onyx deposits]] that lay beneath [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. The motes were adamant that interference with these deposits of the [[docetic materials|docetic material]] would have catastrophic effects not only on [[Known World]] but potentially on the wider [[Nyx]] as well.
