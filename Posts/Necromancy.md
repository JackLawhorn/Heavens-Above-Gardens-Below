Necromancy is a subset of [[organic magics|organic]] and [[materialist magics]] that focuses on the connection between the physical form and [[albedo]], the role of that connection in channeling the magics, and how such powers can be wielded by others. Those who partake in necromancy are feared and reviled by all in the [[Known World]] for their demonic arts, which grant them great and terrible power.

## Mechanics of Necromancy

Necromancy leverages biological material of the races of the [[Orior]], the [[noble beasts]], and other creatures, which are uniquely designed to channel [[albedo]] into their [[organic magics]]. Through a variety of necromantic practices, that energy – and the organic magics imbued within the raw material – can be harnessed as if part of the necromancer's own [[aura]].

Three primary approaches to necromancy exist in the [[Known World]], and vary from practitioner to practitioner. The [[necromancer demons]] of the [[Bouda cackles]] and the [[vulture wakes]] – fallen from their station as [[noble beasts]] – practice transumption, or the consuming of remains to absorb their powers. Bouda and human necromancers are known to preserve remains into demonic artifacts. Lastly, in the mid-[[Renascence period]], the human necromancers of the [[Isle of Melos]] developed a particularly potent practice of [[necromantic grafts|grafting]] remains onto their own bodies.
