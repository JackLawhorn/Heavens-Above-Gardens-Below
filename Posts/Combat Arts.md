Combat Arts are defined styles of fighting, usually involving the use of a weapon, to be trained in and mastered. Though such mastery of a Combat Art is not truly [[extramundane]] in nature, it is a natural consequence of one's [[aura]] and the [[albedo]] stored within it.

## Mechanics of the Combat Arts

Functionally, the development of a Combat Art involves repeated training in and eventual mastery of said fighting style until one's [[aura]] itself is transfigured. The flow of one's [[albedo]] throughout the body is altered to also align with the movements made and weapons used, even leaving the organic form to circulate through the spear or blade as well.

Such alignment affords the wielder of a Combat Art near-[[extramundane]] dexterity, strength, and accuracy, pushing the limits of human ability.

## Combat Arts of the Known World

The Combat Arts found across the [[Known World]] have generally been developed by the many races of the [[Orior]] in service of their adaptation to their own lifestyles and environments. Though some were developed by one people and safeguarded by them, the vast majority would go on to be proliferated among the others they come across.

### Elven Combat Arts

The [[Elven Legion]] have their Combat Arts nearly etched in their auras from birth, requiring little training to attain mastery in their youth. As a consequence of their [[Organic Magics of the Elven Legion#Divine evolution|bioengineering]] at the hands of the [[Angels]], however, they have particular difficulty mastering Combat Arts that are new and foreign to them.

The [[Sun Elves]] are masters of spears and bladed weapons, which they wield to great effect in close combat against the armies of the [[Wild Magics]]. The [[Sea Elves]], limited by their domain under the [[Sink]], instead have a predilection towards their javelins and tridents as they propel themselves towards the enemy at great speeds.

The [[Storm Elves]] are unique among their race in that they find little value in weaponry, preferring instead the ranged, heavy artillery of their [[nyxfire]] bolts.

### Human Combat Arts

The vast majority of the human Combat Arts were developed by the many fractured [[Rookish clans]] in the [[Heliotropic Age]]. Inspired by the beaks and feathers and talons of their [[Mutualist pacts|mutualist]] companions, the many avian races of the [[Noble beasts]], they became masters of a great many ranged and short bladed weapons, including their iconic bladed gauntlets the [[Rookish clans#Talons|talons]]. The [[Fisher Queens]] which branched off from their ranks also developed hooks for the ends of their fishing lines.

Throughout the [[Later Heliotropic Age]] and the [[Crisis of Hubris]], many more were developed by the various warrior classes of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. These would include the axes of the [[Agisters Guild]], the war hammers of the [[Oremongers Guild]] and the smiths that came after [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|their fall]], and just about every other weapon that can be found in the City today.

In the [[Renascence|Renascence period]], the burgeoning [[Blackpowder Guild]] developed their blackpowder firearms and the Combat Arts that incorporated them.

### Combat Arts of the Orior

The other races of the [[Orior]] have developed their own Combat Arts leveraging horn and tooth and talon, as well as weaponry. Some prominent examples included:

- The long, barbed harpoons, razor-sharp fangs, and whip-crack tails of the [[Sobek]]
- The ever-shifting weaponry of the [[Reef Knights]]
- The whips and slashing leaves of the [[Verdant Knights]]
- The pinching claws and pointed, piercing legs of the [[Oklop]]
