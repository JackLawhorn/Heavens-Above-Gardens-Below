## Natural and unavoidable disasters

Natural disasters we face in the real world make us think about our powerlessness. They are unavoidable, appropriately referred to as acts of god which us mortals have no means to prevent. Earthquakes, tornados, and tsunamis are all events that happen largely without warning and can have devastating impacts on the communities they affect. Even those that we can see coming – hurricanes and blizzards to name a few – have throughout history killed millions and devastated entire countries.

This in turn inspires us to empower ourselves to better face future disasters. We have bunkers and alarms and have our school children engage in drills so that they know what to do in these events. There are disaster plans and government protocols for evacuation and rapid response. These methods aren't always the most successful, and often have a habit of lagging behind the immediacy of the disasters themselves, but we are far more armed against these events than our ancestors were.

## Disasters of our own making

Arguably more frightening to the average person are disasters of our own making. In today's world we worry more about terrorism and nuclear war and oppression by our governments than we do about natural disasters. There's something about these disasters being engineered by people like us rather than being random events that could affect us all equally. But this category would also include the consequences of benign actions or even noble and philanthropic efforts. Think about the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters which, even with human error as its cause, also came from our efforts to create much needed energy sources.

These tend to make us fear each other more than anything. There are avenues to protect ourselves, but to many of us these methods don't feel like they're making the world a better place as much as they create a more complex and morally ambiguous world. Protecting ourselves from others often necessitates the sacrificing of personal freedoms for what some would describe as the greater good. They inspire us to draw easily relayed and digestible lines between groups of people, identify some broad demographics as allies and others as enemies.
