## Inspiration

My inspirations for this theme are a little more complex, so I've outlined some of these materials here before going into my personal takeaways and applications for this setting:

### Nicomachean Ethics

Nicomachean Ethics describes a number of Greco-Roman antecedents to the Christian virtues we know today, characterized as a balance in the positive space between two negative extremes.

| Virtue | Concerns | Extremes |
| - | - | - |
| Courage | Fear and confidence | Recklessness and cowardice |
| Temperance | Pleasure and pain | Insensibility and profligacy |
| Liberality (generosity) | Giving and receiving money | Wastefulness and stinginess |
| Magnificence | Giving and receiving greater things | Vulgarity and paltriness |
| Greatness of Soul | Great honor and dishonor | Vanity and Smallness of Soul |
| Appropriate ambition | Lesser honor and dishonor | Over-ambitiousness and lack of ambition |
| Gentleness | Anger | Irritability and spiritlessness |
| Friendliness | General pleasantness | Either obsequiousness or flattery and quarrelsomeness |
| Truthfulness | Truth | Boastfulness and self-deprecation (or understatement)

### Monastic tradition

Evil thoughts categorized as:
- **Physical.** Thoughts produced by the nutritive, sexual, and acquisitive appetites.
- **Emotional.** Thoughts produced by depressive, irascible, or dismissive moods.
- **Mental.** Thoughts produced by jealous/envious, boastful, or hubristic states of mind.

### Seven deadly sins in Christianity

| Vice | [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") | [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") | [Virtue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_virtues "Seven virtues") | Latin | Italian |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |

| [Sloth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloth_(deadly_sin) "Sloth (deadly sin)") | _Acedia_ | _Accidia_ | [Diligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diligence "Diligence") | _Industria_ | _Diligenza_ |
| [Wrath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrath "Wrath") | _Ira_ | - | [Patience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience "Patience") | _Patientia_ | _Pazienza_ |
| [Envy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envy "Envy") | _Invidia_ | - | [Gratitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude "Gratitude") or [Kindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindness "Kindness") | _Gratia_ (_Humanitas_) | _Gratitudine_ |
| [Pride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride "Pride") | _Superbia_ | - | [Humility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humility "Humility") | _Humilitas_ | _Umiltà_ |

At certain points also included:
- **Tristitia:** Sadness, despair, and despondency, generally regarding someone else's good fortune. This ultimately transformed into the sin of "Envy".
- **Vanagloria:** Vainglory and boasting

## Takeaways

The way I see it, there are two categories of virtues/sins to consider in worldbuilding a setting like this: those defined by its inhabitants and those around which the "objective" ethics of the world/universe itself.

For the former, I'm essentially using the [[Crisis of Hubris]] as an extended cautionary tale that imparts a mix of lessons to humanity, and which much of the rest of their history will be in reaction to. The fall of the [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the [[Court]] are storied throughout human history and the history of the [[Known World]], and each has been analyzed and mythologized to no end:
| [[Fallen House]] | Their fall | Sin | Notes |
| - | - | - | - |
| [[Oremongers Guild]] | [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild]] | Doubleness | A deficit of the Nicomachean virtue of Truthfulness |
| [[House Lightbringer]] | [[Fall of House Lightbringer]] | Avarice | Analog to the Christian sin of Greed |
| [[Materialists College]] | [[Fall of the Materialists College]] | Corruption | In practice, an analog to the Christian sin of Envy |
| [[Disciples of the Pretender]] | [[Fall of the Pretender]] | Ignorance | Nicomachean Vanity and Over-ambitiousness |
| [[Silver Wolves]]  | Fall of the Silver Wolves | Betrayal | In practice, an analog to Nicomachean Paltriness |

For more "objective" or universally relevant ethics, I've used the [[Dragon]] and its [[Vestiges]] and [[Umbral Aspects]] to represent some additional sins, namely: Oblivion, Madness, Despair, Entropy, Hunger, and Wrath.
