[[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]] of more diluted divinity than their parents the [[Major Aspects]]. The oldest and most powerful of their ranks are the [[Giants]].

## Domains of the Minor Aspects

The domains of the Minor Aspects are less concretely defined, often arising from the subjective experiences of the peoples of the [[Known World]] and their limited understanding of those experiences. Where the [[Mundial Aspects]] govern elements and landscapes that are readily and concretely defined, Minor Aspects like the [[Giants]] govern the abstract concept of the surface and the sky and the horizon that separates them.

These [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]] – born out of the chaos of the [[Wild Magics]] and their [[nyxfire]] storms rather than from the divine design of the [[Angels]] – have been known to manifest in response to myths and beliefs and superstitions of the peoples of the [[Orior]]. In the ages that arose after the founding of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], a great many Minor Aspects have appeared to govern domains of civilization itself such as streets, bridges, towers, and even bathrooms.
