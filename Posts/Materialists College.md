## History of the Materialists College

> For more on the history of [[materialist magics]], see [[History of materialist magics]].

Founded by the herbalists of the [[Elven March|Elven March period]] and the botanists of the [[Later Heliotropic Age]] soon after the [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founding]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[Materialists College]] quickly rose to prominence as one of the original [[Great House|Great Houses]] of the [[Court]]. Even after their particularly disgraceful [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]], their legacy as those who developed [[Materialist magics|materialism]] as a [[Magics in the Known World|field of magics]] is carried forward.

Their work, which allowed humanity – born without [[organic magics]] of their own – to more readily access magics, led to a great proliferation of materialist trinkets throughout the City. Immediately after the [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]], when humanity learned the true risks of entering into [[iconic pacts]] with the [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]], these quickly became the magics of choice among this people despite affording lesser power.

During their time as a Great House, they founded the [[Scholars Quarter]] and ultimately came to lead and represent the many [[scholars of the City]]. Taking on this role, the [[College]] was largely responsible for the proliferation of humanity's scholarly endeavors.

### The Red Death period

The decline of the [[College]] began during the [[Red Death period]], throughout which they failed again and again to find a solution to the problem of the [[Red Court]] and their [[soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] who had besieged [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. The minor magics afforded to the [[Materialist magics|materialists]] by their trinkets and bobbles did not make them affective [[Apotropaics]], nor were they particularly inclined towards martial combat.

Their greatest contribution was the discovery of their weakness to the light of [[Ylem]], which informed the decision to launch the [[Known World]] into the [[Long Daylight]]. Failing to eradicate the threat, this plan was instead considered to have worsened the situation. The shadows cast by the harsh light of the [[Elven Signaltower]] and its [[nyxfire]] flame were particularly deep and allowed the soldiers of the Red Court to thrive and multiply and more effectively dig into the City of Gardens. Additionally, there were a great many other consequences to the Long Daylight for decades to come.

This period also sowed the seeds of a greater loss, the [[Fall of the Materialists College]] as the third [[Fallen Houses|Fallen House]] of the [[Crisis of Hubris]], as the ghoulish [[necromancer demons]] arose from the College anatomists who studied the corpses of this period.

### Fall of the Materialists College

From the [[College]] anatomists of the [[Red Death period]] arose the [[necromancers]], who proved themselves to be the most powerful of the [[Materialist magics|materialists]]. These ghoulish mages were alchemists and poachers, who hunted [[noble beasts]] and other races of the [[Orior]] in secret. From their prey, they took raw materials which they leveraged to create powerful artifacts that granted them magics resembling the [[organic magics]] of these peoples.

In the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], a congregation of [[Sobek]] marched into [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], escorted – unbelievably – by the first [[Sun Elves]] seen by humanity since their departure from the [[City of Gardens]] in the [[Later Heliotropic Age]]. They brought with them the truth of the College's "exploratory excursions," during which necromancer death squads slaughtered entire settlements and cultures for their raw materials. Formally condemned by the other [[Great House|Great Houses]] and their [[Orator|Orators]], the Materialists College was abolished and necromancy outlawed.

## Role in the City

As a [[Great House]] of the [[Court]], the Materialists College held great power in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and were certainly one of the most prominent [[House|Houses]] within human society from the [[Later Heliotropic Age]] through to their [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]]. They wielded their political power selectively and conservatively – certainly more so than the [[Psionics College]] which would rise from their ashes – and primarily to forward their own agenda: the development of human scholarship and scholarly endeavors both of their own and led by the other [[scholars of the City]].

### Legendary human scholars

The first [[College]] founded in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[Scholars Quarter]] rose up around the hallowed grounds of the Materialists College. As a [[Great House]] and the first and greatest of the human scholars, they would come to serve as the leaders of the many [[scholars of the City]] as well as of the Quarter itself. In many ways, all of humanity's scholarly endeavors – considered by many [[Scholars of the City#Subjectivists|subjectivist]] scholars to be their defining characteristic which separates our people from the other races of the [[Orior]] – can be traced back to their initial studies and those of the other scholars which they helped to rise up.

### Materialist magics in the City

Just as they guided and rose up human scholarship, the Materialists College's role in developing the [[Magics in the Known World|field of magics]] of [[Materialist magics|materialism]] changed the course of not only human history but also that of the [[Known World]]. These developments enabled humanity within [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] – born without [[organic magics]] of their own – to more readily access magics. Since their founding and even past their [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]], this remains one of the greatest weapons and sources of power wielded by their people. Today, materialist trinkets are a common sight in the City and are carried by nearly ever class of every [[House]] and faction.

## Legacy of the Materialists College

After their particularly disgraceful [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]], after which the [[College]] itself was abolished and [[Necromancy]] outlawed, the now [[House|Houseless]] [[necromancer demons]] fled [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] both in fear of persecution and in order to continue their dark and ghoulish experiments. Today, [[Ages of the Known World|ages]] after the fall itself, their legacy and influence can still be felt throughout the [[Known World]].

Some specific examples are listed below.
