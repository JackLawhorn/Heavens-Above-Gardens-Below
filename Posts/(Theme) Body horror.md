## Bodily transformations

Body horror at its core explores the limits and transformative capabilities of the human body. Some specific questions that come to mind:
- How can the human body be practically improved? Can the human body be perfected? If possible, what costs would those improvements and that perfection be worth paying?
- Does the soul truly exist? If so, is it a physiological component of the body, a psychological component of the mind, both, or neither? What effect might altering one or the other have on the soul?
- What separates humans from creatures? Where is the line between human and inhuman if the mind stays unchanged and only the body is transformed? Can one's humanity withstand transformation into something inhuman?
- How much or how little do we truly know about the human body? What about the human body is unknown or misunderstood? What might be true that cannot be known or understood without pushing the human body to its limits?

## Agency revoked

A common theme in works of body horror is agency as a core pillar of our humanity and the horror of having that agency taken away from us. Popular monsters like zombies and vampires tend to explore this idea, being in possession of an unquenchable hunger/thirst. Whether or not the monsters themselves are conscious enough to realize this horror – not the case in most iterations of zombies but usually the case for vampires – us as the audience are confronted by the possibility of not being in control of our own actions.

Mind control fiction is another subgenre where this is explored, but in body horror there is an additional dimension of it having a viscerally physical source. There's something about the physical rather than the psychological that really enhances this concept for me (although I do embrace both in the case of the [[Red Court]]).

## Exploring biopunk

The body horror subgenre also intersects with the biopunk genre/aesthetic. Biopunk is such a fun and engaging aesthetic and it's one I'll be exploring in a number of different ways throughout this project. First, through the [[Red Court]] and its [[hexecraft pacts]] which can warp the bodies of its victims into weapons to serve its unholy purposes. Later, this will inspire a number of human endeavors that could present as both body horror biopunk: namely the [[necromancer demons]] of the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fallen]] [[Materialists College]] and the [[hexecraft pacts]] of the [[witches]]. Finally, the concept of [[Near-life]] which applies not only to the [[soldiers of the Red Court]] but also to the [[Simulacra]] of [[House Talos]].

Biopunk in the fantasy genre specifically – as opposed to science fiction and cyberpunk where it is most commonly relegated – affords me the ability to explore some more high concept ideas and lend more of a horror-tinted lens to this setting. As a vehicle for delivering body horror, I can explore bodily transformations forced onto others, the obsessive need for power and perfection, and the idea of bargaining with the entities that govern reality itself to exceed the body's limits and reach new peaks.

How biopunk enhancements are approached and embraced tell us a lot about what is valued in this society. If the people of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] value power in the form of combat prowess, the enhancements sought out should align with that motivation. The need to reach that achievement also tells us a lot about how much work, effort, sacrifice, and cost they might consider worth getting there.
