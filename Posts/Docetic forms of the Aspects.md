## Communication with the Aspects

Verbal communication with the physical manifestations of the [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]] is most common with the [[Minor Aspects]], especially those who imitate the anatomy of the [[Orior]] through the process of [[formitation]]. It is much more common, however, for communication to be non-verbal.

The [[Mundial Aspects]] do formitate, but generally communicate through the [[Astral Sphere]], appearing to ripple and vibrate and display influence over the surrounding environment. Being on the other end of such an interaction – during which one's connection to the Astral Sphere is significantly but temporarily deepened – is often disorienting and can even be an enlightening experience.

Aspects who manifest within the [[Prime Material Sphere]] as single [[#Materials and artifacts|docetic artifacts]] most often communicate non-verbally over a short distance: usually limited to within eye-sight or perhaps requiring physical contact. Long- or short-range telecommunication is most commonly seen with the [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar]] and [[Umbral Aspects]]. [[Docetic materials]] are often used as channels for telecommunication between [[Iconic pacts|patron]] Aspects and their worshippers.

## Common docetic forms

### Formitation

> For more, see [[Formitation]].

It is common for [[Aspect|Aspects]] to take on the form of the [[Orior]] and the [[noble beasts]], mimicking those they interact with through a process called [[formitation]]. Maintaining such a form is relatively inexpensive compared to maintaining a more permanent form within the [[Prime Material Sphere]] that is sustained when not observed by the children of the [[Angels]]. Entities such as the [[Mundial Aspects#elemental motes|elemental motes]], which are a common sight in the [[Known World]], are well known for manifesting in this way.

### Flora and fauna

Many [[Aspect|Aspects]] are are known to take on forms recognizable as flora and fauna. This is common for [[Ylem]] worshipped primarily by [[noble beasts]] rather than by the races of the [[Orior]]. It is sometimes unknown whether the mundane creatures arose after the birth of their [[Iconic pacts|patron]] and evolved to closely mimic their appearance or if the [[docetic]] form of the Aspect mimics their worshippers.

Others do not closely mimic mundane creatures but rather appear as twisted, otherworldly distortions of them. [[Dire beasts]] are [[Minor Aspects]] that manifest as larger and more deadly versions of the creatures they govern.

### Natural phenomena

All natural phenomena – both in the [[Known World]] and in the [[Nyx]] above – are tied to the presence the [[Aspect|Aspects]], most often [[Minor Aspects]] who lack the influence to sustain physical forms. More powerful Aspects may maintain a sustained form within the [[Astral Sphere]], which manifests as constellation of stars in the night sky. Other examples include auroras, magnetism, rusting, decomposition, earthquakes, landslides, erosion, and the waves of the [[Sink]] to name a few.

### Docetic materials

Some [[Aspect|Aspects]], like the [[Wolf Mother]], have large [[docetic]] forms, slivers of which can be found all over the [[Known World]] – in her case as deposits of [[silver]] come crashing down from her [[silver moon|lunar form]]. Such [[docetic materials]] are imbued with a proportional amount of the Aspect's own power relative to the whole.

### Places of Power

> For more, see [[Places of Power]].

[[Places of Power]] may be created by the prolonged presence of an [[Aspect]], or could be the form it takes itself. Some Places of Power are instead created by the races of the [[Orior]] and the [[noble beasts]], the sites of great events and legends. In these cases, guardian [[Ylem]] are often born to protect the site – halfway between a wandering spirit bound to the place and the [[docetic]] form of the place itself.

Some Ylem manifest as an [[extra-physical]] [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Sphere]] either in addition to a physical form or in place of one. These Spheres overlap with the [[Prime Material Sphere]], and are accessible from through certain means specific to the Aspect. One infamous example is the Sphere of the [[Red Court]] in which the [[Wolf Mother]] was imprisoned throughout the [[Red Death period]].
