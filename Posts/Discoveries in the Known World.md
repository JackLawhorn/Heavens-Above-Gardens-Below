> This is a broad overview of the discoveries made during the [[Elven March|Elven March period]] and many of these details are extrapolated from oral history during [[Reconstruction]]. All historical artifacts from this time period are believed to have been lost during the [[Burning|Burning of the City]].
> 
> Believed to have comprised the vast majority of the [[Heliotropic Age]], it is nearly impossible to catalog the discoveries made in their entirety, let alone in one historical document. Please see referenced materials for additional detail.

The march across the [[Known World]] – and especially the lands of the north that were traversed during the [[Elven March|Elven March period]] – by the [[Sun Elves]] and the early humans brought many discoveries for both peoples.

This world had [[Fallen World|fallen]] to the rebellious [[Wild Magics]] and their storms of pure [[nyxfire]], which the [[Elven Legion]] had come to tame. In their wake, the landscape and its inhabitants would have been unrecognizable as those of the [[Old World]] – warped by the bending of the [[Laws of Power]].

## The roiling of the elements

The [[Lunar Aspects]] – particularly the [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]], the [[Mundial Aspects#water motes|water motes]], and the [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind motes]] all of whom the [[Sun Elves]] called the [[Mundial Aspects]] – were greatly affected by the storms. Whipped into a frenzy and locked in millennia of conflict with each other, the terrain was in constant and violent motion.

The Elves called this the [[roiling of the elements|"roiling of the elements"]], which their [[Griot|Griots]] said mimicked the [[roiling of the Nyx]] amidst conflict between the [[Angels]] and the [[Glossary/Dragon]]. When the storms were tamed, the motes and their domains were freed from this cycle and largely settled into place.

## Perils of the Known World

Nomadic life along the [[Elven March]] may have been in the nature of the [[Elven Legion]], but it was rife with peril for both them and for the humans. The [[Wild Magics]] were not so keen to be tamed, and from their [[nyxfire]] storms emerged adversaries evolved to go to war on their behalf just as the [[Angels]] had created their Elves.

Though ravenous and largely underdeveloped, the [[goblins|goblin clans]] emerged from the storms with histories and cultures and civilizations all their own, evolved in just hours through the bending of the [[Laws of Power]]. These enemies the Elves dispatched with particular fervor.

## Allies and magics

Straggling behind the march of the [[Sun Elves]] for untold generations, the [[Human clans]] were often themselves vulnerable.

### Noble beasts

It wasn't until the later [[Heliotropic Age]] and the [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founding]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] that either the Elves or humans would encounter other races of the [[Orior]], but they quickly made other allies. Some races of beasts, which the [[Elven Legion|Legion]] called the "noble beasts", were able to speak the [[Organic magics of the Elven Legion#Elven Tongue|Elven Tongue]].

Many of the disparate [[Human clans]] formed [[Mutualist pacts]] with these races of beasts, bonding both peoples for generations and granting them access to minor magics of their own.

### The Aspects of Ylem

Of particular concern was the humans' lack of [[organic magics]] which the Elves and later races of the [[Orior]] all seemed to possess. Just as some made [[Pact magics|pacts]] with the races of the [[#noble beasts]], others sought to gain power from [[Ylem]] themselves through [[Iconic pacts]].

Once tamed by the [[Sun Elves]] the [[Wild Magics|Wild Magic]] settled into what they called the [[Minor Aspects]] of Ylem. These Minor Aspects are children and grandchildren and distant descendants of the [[Mundial Aspects#elemental motes|elemental motes]], governing minor domains within the [[Known World]]. One prominent example is [[Sobek (Minor Aspect)|Sobek]], the patron [[Aspect]] of rivers and namesake of the [[Sobek riverfolk]] who worship her.

These campaigns also enabled the [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar]] and [[Mundial Aspects]] to converse with humanity and come into pacts of their own. Prominent examples include the [[Silver Wolves]] and the [[Oremongers Guild]] respectively.
