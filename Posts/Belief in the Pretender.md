At the [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of the [[Psionic Age]], all understanding of [[psionics]] centered around the first human [[psion]] now known only as the [[Pretender]]. It was they who spread [[psionics#psionic influence|psionic influence]] throughout the human population in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and it was their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] who pioneered the [[Mystic psionics]] of that time. Until their [[fall]], the Pretender was considered by much of humanity almost as an [[Aspect]] of [[Ylem]] themselves.

The [[Pretender]] amassed tens of [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] the very day of their [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revelation]], continued spreading [[psionics#psionic influence|psionic influence]] throughout the human population for many years afterward. By their [[Questing Charter of the Pretender|departure]] on their religious pilgrimage, they numbered in the thousands – far greater than the ranks of any of the [[Iconic House|heterodoxies]] of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies|Canon]].

During that period, the Disciples of the Pretender were not only a common sight in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], but they were more or less impossible to ignore as beautiful [[#Illusions in the City|illusions]] bloomed in their presence. Such miracles had a palpable effect on the City and its populace, who were still reeling from the [[Red Death period]] and more recently the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]] of the [[Materialists College]]. Humanity saw a period of collective peace and even celebration never before seen, not even in the [[Later Heliotropic Age]] that had preceded this [[Crisis of Hubris]].

### Illusions in the City

The [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of the [[Psionic Age]] is best remembered for the massive [[Psionics#Hallucination|hallucinations]] – called [[Mystic psionics#illusionist|illusions]] by the [[Mystic psionics|mystic psions]] of the day – that bloomed throughout [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Stepping into a particular market or garden or alleyway revealed a sometimes overstimulating array of illusions, and various quarters and districts came to be known for the Illusionists who called them home.

The camps of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] were densely populated with impossibly beautiful sights, sounds, tastes, and pleasures, which succeeded in seducing thousands into [[Psionics|psionic]] awakening and often religious belief in the [[Pretender]].

### Quests of the Disciples of the Pretender

> For more, see [[Disciples of the Pretender#Quests of the Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples of the Pretender > Quests of the Disciples of the Pretender]].

The [[Mystic psionics|mystic practices]] of the [[Pretender]] were rife with both major and minor [[Quest|quests]] which at the [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of the [[Psionic Age]] saw a return to [[quest#questing culture|questing culture]] by many of their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]]. These quests ranged from missionary work – spreading faith in the Pretender throughout the creation of [[Mystic psionics#Illusionist|illusions]] and by awakening new Disciples to their [[Psionics#Psionic influence|psionic influence]] – to protecting the populace from the newfound threats of the [[Psionic Sphere]] and even to exploring this new frontier.

Such quests gave rise to a number of [[Mystic psionics#Classes of the mystic psions|classes]] of [[Psion|psions]]: [[Mystic psionics#Psiknight|Psiknights]], [[Mystic psionics#Dwaalstepper|Dwaalsteppers]], and [[Mystic psionics#Illusionist|Illusionists]]. Taking on the burden of these stations and completing quests from the Pretender themselves enabled a select few to gain significant favor and become leaders of the [[Psionics|psionic]] community.

### Belief in the Court

Belief in the [[Pretender]] was as widespread throughout the [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] of the [[Court]] as it was throughout [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], and this lent them and their [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] a considerable amount of influence. They were quickly granted [[House|Houseship]], notably without the support of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]].

Though the remaining [[Great House|Great Houses]] at the time – the [[House of the Sun]] and the [[Silver Wolves]] of [[Clan Wolfstepper]] – were among those wary of such influence, they were ultimately able to leverage this belief. When the Pretender made it known that they and their Disciples intended to depart from the City on a [[Questing Charter of the Pretender|religious pilgrimage]], the [[Orator|Orators]] expedited the Court in naming the [[cults|cult]] as the sixth Great House of humanity. This motion saw wide support and effectively ensured that they would leave en masse and in peace.

## After the fall of the Pretender

Belief in the [[Pretender]] fell dramatically after their [[Fall of the Pretender|fall]] and even the few [[Mystic psionics|mystic psions]] who remain generally do not attribute their [[Quest|quests]] to this faith. The fall, like the others of the [[Crisis of Hubris]], was canonized as a moral, cultural, and existential failing of humanity. This outcome is widely understood to have been foreseen by the [[House of the Sun]] and its motivation for naming the cult as the sixth [[Great House]] of the [[Court]].

The remnants of those the Pretender awakened back in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] went on to found the [[Psionics College]]. In the years that followed, it became increasingly clear that [[psionics]] came not from a divine source but was instead understandable through science as a natural phenomenon of the [[Nyx]]. Today, in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], nearly all practitioners of psionics do so through the [[College]]'s [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist]] lens.
