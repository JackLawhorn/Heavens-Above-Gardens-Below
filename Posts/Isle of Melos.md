The Isle of Melos was the first [[Isles of the Great Sea|Isle]] of the [[Great Sea]] to be settled by humanity and is the oldest surviving human settlement outside of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Founded by the [[Fall of the Materialists College#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exiled]] [[Necromancer demons]] of the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fallen]] [[Materialists College]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], it remains their base of operations, but has also grown into a thriving [[#trade port]] thanks to its valuable resources and continued relationships with the [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] of the [[Questing Houses]].

## Geography and resources

Melos is the southernmost [[Isles of the Great Sea|Isle]] of the [[Great Sea]]'s [[Great Sea#Stellar Isles|Stellar Isles]] constellation. It's closest neighbor is [[House Talos]] and its garden of [[Simulacra]].

It measures 30,000 strides from east to west, 17,000 strides from north to south, and reaches a maximum altitude of 1,000 strides. Like the rest of the cluster, the Isle is of volcanic origin and is considered to still be a dormant volcano that could erupt again. The natural harbor is the hollow of the principal crater. In one of the caves on the south coast, the heat from the volcano is still great, and on the eastern shore of the harbor, there are hot sulfurous springs.

The Isle is rich in a wide variety of natural resources. [[Docetic materials#Brimstone (Sulfur)|Brimstone]] deposits and various volcanic stones are naturally forming, and its volcanic soil readily promotes growth of a number of key crops. Oranges, olives, cypress, tamarisk and juniper trees are all native to Melos and its inhabitants have introduced cotton, barley, and other valuable crops.

## History of the Isle of Melos

The Isle of Melos was founded by the [[Fall of the Materialists College#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exiled]] [[Necromancer demons]] of the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fallen]] [[Materialists College]] from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Thanks to their former station as a [[Great House]], those sentenced by the [[Court]] were afforded the aid of the [[Shipwrights Guild]] to find a new home to settle, and were later joined by those who had already fled the consequences of their [[Fallen Houses|fall]].

The [[Isles of the Great Sea|Isle]] was not found to be inhabited by any [[noble beasts]] or races of the [[Orior]], nor was any evidence of past settlements found. Throughout the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] and the [[Early Renascence period]], the demons developed the land greatly and became self-sustaining there. They found a number of valuable [[#Geography and resources|natural resources]], and found it easy to introduce crops from the seeds they had brought with them.

With the proliferation of the [[Questing Houses]] and their [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] across the [[Great Sea]] in the [[Later Renascence period]], Melos saw significant growth as a [[#trade port]] thanks to their prized resources. Establishing themselves as power brokers, the demons were able to establish strong new [[#diplomatic relations]] outside of the jurisdiction of the City of Gardens and its Court.

## Demons of Melos

The Isle of Melos is governed by the [[Necromancer demons]] who settled it, though their [[Necromancy|controversial experiments]] are performed far away from the [[#trade port]] where their [[#Diplomatic relations|trade partners]] might see and object to them. This work does, of course, continue up in the hills of the [[Isles of the Great Sea|Isle]], but a significant portion of the population is now devoted entirely to maintaining the fields of crops, owning and facilitating businesses in the port, and engaging in purely diplomatic activities both at home and abroad.

As of the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]], it is ruled by two separate parties. The Governor of Melos manages the state and the settlement's outward image, while the work of the demons themselves are governed by four powerful [[Necromancer Archdevils|Archdevils]].

### Unholy Reliquaries

High upon the hill and far from the harbor where respectable [[#trade port|trade]] takes place, the Isle of Melos houses four megastructures, known as the Unholy Reliquaries, in which raw materials are stored and preserved for the macabre experiments of the [[Necromancer demons]]. They are the *Ossuarium* which houses teeth, talons, and bones; the *Sanguinarium* which houses blood in liquid, dried, and separated forms; the *Spoliarium* which houses flesh, meat, and organs; and the *Pellemarium* which houses coats, furs, and skins. Each is under the governing of one of the four [[Necromancer Archdevils|Archdevils]].

## Trade port

The Isle of Melos has grown into the predominant trade port of the [[Great Sea]], servicing the [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colony]] [[Isles of the Great Sea|Isles]] of the [[Questing Houses]]. Its crops and [[#Geography and resources|natural resources]] are extremely valuable to these trade partners, as are its exports of [[docetic materials#brimstone (sulfur)|brimstone]] and other [[Alchemy|alchemical]] ingredients and byproducts. The magics of the [[Necromancer demons]] also readily produce demonic artifacts, granting them powerful, [[extramundane]] abilities and allowing them to become some of the [[Known World]]'s foremost power brokers.

### Diplomatic relations

Though still under strict [[Fall of the Materialists College#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exile]] by the [[Court]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] of the [[Questing Houses]] are under only the most minor of obligations to uphold the [[Law and justice in the City|laws of the City]]. The [[Blackpowder Guild]] and the rest of the [[Engineers Union]] are common collaborators with the [[#demons of Melos]], as well as most of the other [[Isles of the Great Sea|Isle]] colonies dotting the [[Great Sea]] who depend on trade with Melos.
