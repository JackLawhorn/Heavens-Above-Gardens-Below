When the [[House of the Sun]]'s [[Orator]] declared the end of the [[Crisis of Hubris]], she used her newfound power as the sole Orator of the [[Court]] to establish a state religion in worship of [[Ylem]] so that such darkness might never return. For over an [[Ages of the Known World|age]] since, rituals such as the [[#The Homa|Homa]] have been stewarded by the House of the Sun and performed by the vast majority of humanity within [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

The state religion specifically revolves around acts of worship towards Ylem rather than or in addition to its various [[Aspect|Aspects]]. This system works in tandem with the [[Henotheist|Henotheistic]] culture of the City, with the [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] engaging in acts of worship towards both Ylem and their own [[iconic pacts|patrons]].

## The Homa

The *Homa* is a daily ritual at the heart of the [[House of the Sun]]'s state religion in which an offering is burned in sacrifice to [[Ylem]]. For the vast majority of practicing worshippers, this offering consists of a portion of one's food. For some, such as the smiths and craftsmen of the [[Houses of Industry]], an offering might instead consist of a portion of the day's production.

The most devote in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] walk the length of its [[rayas]] every day, performing the Homa at the foot of the [[Elven Signaltower]] and effectively tracing the City's [[rota]]. This is uncommon however, with most doing so only once per year at most. The least devoted may not perform the Homa at all for several days before continuing to do so.
