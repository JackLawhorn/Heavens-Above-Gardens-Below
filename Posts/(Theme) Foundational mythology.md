One of the primary themes I'm trying to tackle with the setting of "Heavens Above; Gardens Below" (HAGB) is foundational mythology: the stories that shape the world and help others to understand it.

## Cosmology and mythology

I knew that I wanted to incorporate mythology that tackles the source of all creation in this setting. And considering my concept for the Elven race as space travelers, I wanted to explore the intersection of this mythology with a greater cosmology that extended past the primary world of the setting.

**Some specific questions:**

- What exactly is the cosmology at its most fundamental level? How did reality come to be and what existed before then? How can unreality be conceptualized and what would fighting it look like?
- How does a greater cosmology affect the lives of those – especially normal humans – living within it? How would these two systems interact with each other and how would perception of this reality differ from vastly different scales of perspective?
- How exactly does the grim dark philosophy of Lovecraftian cosmicism interact with the often noble tone of fantasy? What would it look like for two sub-settings at two very different scopes and with different tones to slowly come into alignment with each other?

## The Elves as a promethean race

I came up with the idea for the Elves in this setting first because I've typically been underwhelmed with their archetype in other fantasy settings. My idea was that I could find a version of them that was different and that engaged me, and that that would be an interesting starting point for the setting as a whole.

A huge part of the initial concept was leaning into the promethean myth and what that would mean for lesser – in this case objectively so – races like normal humans.

**Some specific questions:**

- What gifts could a promethean race give to humanity that would be most influential? What would the greater consequences of that influence look like generations and even millennia later?
- What influence would such a race have beyond the direct gifts they leave behind? How do peoples influence each other in general and what determines the directionality of that influence?
- What does it mean for one people race to coexist with another in a system where one is objectively superior to the other? What responsibility would the former have in supporting, protecting, and developing the latter?

## Mythology as experienced truth

One popular understanding of mythology is as a vehicle for a shared understanding of how the world works. This is necessarily at odds with a setting where the unrealistic and impossible is not a story but in fact the experienced truth.

For my purposes, mythology is both an in-world phenomenon created and experienced by the setting's inhabitants _and_ a source of inspiration for the setting itself.

**Some specific questions:**

- What are the necessary, atomic components of a comprehensive real-world mythology? Which of those components can be implemented as objective reality that is still believable within the context of a fantasy setting?
- Where does the line lay between history and mythology? How is that line blurred by limited understanding? How does one reckon greater understanding with existing mythology?
