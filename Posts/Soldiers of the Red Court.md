Once the body has been conquered by the [[Hexecraft pacts|hex]] of the [[Red Death]] and the infected have regressed to a [[Near-life]] state, the influence of the [[Red Court]] begins to inflict a number of more sizable transformations fueled by the drained [[albedo]].

The Red Court's complete domination over every cell in the body affords the infected a form of autotomic regeneration. Severed limbs do not regenerate, but are able to continue operating as autonomous creatures themselves. Nearly any organ in the body is able to grow new feeding *aparata* and resume feeding.

## The Hunger

The [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] possess an ever-present and all-consuming hunger for [[albedo]]. Weeks of isolated sickness starve the newly infected, sapping them of their hope along with their strength. The hunger first appears at this low point, and they shamble out of their plague dens looking for uninfected victims.

It is believed that extended periods without sustenance can worsen and speed up the bodily transformations. Like simple beasts, they will grow desperate and frenzied if the hunger isn't satisfied.

## Vulnerabilities

The soldiers of the [[Red Court]] share a number of vulnerabilities that are common across the [[Umbral Aspects]] and their accursed allies. Fire and light are much-diluted forms of the divinity of [[Ylem]] and as such are deadly weapons against these foes. While only warded off and disoriented by indirect light, direct contact with flames or with the light of Ylem – such as that of the [[Elven Signaltower]] – will make them violently combust and kill all of the infected organic matter.

[[Docetic materials#Silver|Silver]], a [[Docetic materials|docetic material]] with extremely high [[albedo]], is also extremely effective for the same reason. It's presence has much the same effect as indirect light and can ward away the soldiers of the Red Court, but direct contact with silver works to deactivate some of their [[extramundane]] properties. Pure silver and [[silvered]] blades can slice clean through an [[#Apex Vectors|Apex Vector]] without allowing it to regenerate.

Unlike the other Umbral Aspects, the soldiers of the Red Court also displayed some sort of fear of or aversion to water – specifically running water like that of the river [[Torrente]] and the sea water of the [[Sink]]. This was thought by the scholars of the [[Materialists College]] to be a physiological factor imposed by the [[Red Death]].

## Classes of the infected

### Apex Vectors

Though little is known about the reasoning or criteria behind the process, certain infected are granted favor by the [[Red Court]] and are able to evolve into more dangerous and effective predators known as Apex Vectors. It is thought that some traits are passed down from previous generations of the infected, such as the [[Nycter]].

Common transformations include the development of talons, a hardened hide, as well as fangs and new muscles around the mouth designed to aid in feeding processes. In pronounced cases, fanged mandibles or wing-like membranes may also develop. They seem to possess significantly developed auditory and olfactory sensory mechanisms which take the place of a rapidly regressing sense of sight.

### Shambling Mounds

The unluckiest of the [[Red Court]]'s victims are those who die while being fed upon by the infected, only to be violently wrenched back to a state of [[Near-life]]. After predation, too little is left of corpses to still serve their master as effective predators and vectors of the [[Red Death]]. And so their remains crawl towards each other to form new horrors. These Shambling Mounds of flesh, blood, and bone rearrange in an attempt to optimize their killing power, often possessing an unnatural and unsettling collection of parts and extremities.

Though they are less effective as predators, Shambling Mounds possess certain unique abilities. For example, their already torn apart bodies are able to temporarily de-solidify to slip through small gaps. Upon being attacked with a torch or other source of fire, they are also able to quickly burst, saving as much infected materials as possible by launching matter far from the deadly flames and spraying those nearby with their infectious matter.
