Shade motes are relatively minor [[Umbral Aspects]] who populate an [[extramundane]] biome known as the [[Shades]]. Their domain is that of darkness but only appear in areas of true darkness, in the shadows cast by the harsh light of [[Ylem]].

## Draconic heritage

Shade motes are minor [[Umbral Aspects]], descended from the [[Dragon]] itself and given life by [[Oblivion]] before it was struck down by the [[Angels]]. Many other Umbral Aspects are known to manifest [[Shades]] and shade motes by their influence within the [[Prime Material Sphere]].

The stories of the [[Sun Elves]] – if they are to be believed – purport that [[Verdigris]] held [[iconic pacts]] with the shade motes and that this [[Known World]] in its infancy was shaped from the darkness just as it is now shaped by the light of [[Ylem]]. In this time, before light arrived in this world, these motes would have held significantly greater influence on the physical world.

## Nature of the Shade motes

These motes are native to the [[Shades]], an [[extramundane]] and much [[benighted]] biome that arises in the shadows cast by the harsh light of pure [[nyxfire]]. In some settings, they appear as great, billowing plumes of black smoke. In others they are all encompassing, the very shadows themselves come to life.

Like the flora and fauna that populate this environment, the shade motes are not necessarily malicious. They manifest among a people's fear and strife, and thus wield tremendous power within the [[Psionic Sphere]], but do not assert much influence in the [[Prime Material Sphere]]. In fact, shade motes are the most benign of the [[Umbral Aspects]], primarily watchers on like their counterpart the [[nyxfire motes]]. They have even been known to interact and play with humans, especially human children but have a predilection towards trickery. In areas of all-encompassing darkness, they are capable of summoning [[phantom flames]], balls of false light that often lure passersby deeper into treacherous woods, swamps, and caves. The true nature of this phenomenon is unknown, but they are oft-reported by those who survive to tell tales of being lost in such low places.

### Counterparts to the nyxfire motes

The shade motes are most often contrasted against the [[nyxfire motes]], and the two can be considered counterparts. Where the latter radiates light and warmth and represents the divinity of [[Ylem]], the former proliferates darkness and cold and descends from the [[Dragon]] itself. The nyxfire motes are more powerful than the [[Umbral Aspects]] and the rest of the [[Major Aspects]], but it is their light that casts the shadows of the [[Shades]] themselves and so they can never truly defeat this dark reflection.
