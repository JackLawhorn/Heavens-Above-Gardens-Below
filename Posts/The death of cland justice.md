The death of [[cland]] justice came at the hands of a single crime, details of which are lost to history – and which even at the time was not clearly understood. Today it is remembered as heinous enough to have captured the attention of all who called [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] home, and complex enough to have been found impossible to effectively prosecute before the [[Orator|Orators]] of the [[Court]].

The crime scene was found early one morning along the fourth [[rayas|raya]], having been committed the previous night. Somehow, the night patrols who walk the streets and the rooftops had not discovered the scene, and so it quickly grew into a spectacle in the light of day. The rayas were the veins of the City along which commerce and communication and the populace itself travelled, and so by midday a large crowd of neighbors and concerned passersby had accumulated there.

Crime – even violent crime – was not uncommon at this time, especially along the [[Elven March]] and in the period of the [[Later Heliotropic Age]] before the [[naming of the Great Houses|naming]] of the [[Great House|Great Houses]]. Assault and murder and especially theft was committed, and the [[human clans]] took it upon themselves to investigate the events in question, punish those responsible, and ensure any possible reparations for the victims. The clans, even those now granted [[House|Houseship]] in Court, saw to their own forms of justice for their own people and did not answer to any higher power than their own morals.

And so it was not the specifics of this particular crime but the response to it by those seeking to enact justice that set it apart.

It was the young [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] and the paladins of its many [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] who first trampled upon the crime scene. Eager to enact justice, the agents of various [[iconic pacts|patron]] [[Aspect|Aspects]] tainted the scene and competed and fought with each other and collected evidence for themselves. In truth they were no better than the crowd that had gathered, which quickly turned frustrated and aggressive. So by the time the [[Silver Wolves]] arrived, even their [[extramundane]] sense of smell was rendered useless in tracking the culprit or culprits.

Slipping in amongst the crowd and observing from the rooftops, flocks of [[Rookish clans|rooks]] took it upon themselves to scour the City in search of justice. In truth acting as vigilantes, they questioned the low peoples who they found in their usual places. Clan leaders who hadn't been able to successfully argue for Houseship, sequestered in the taverns of the City as they waited for their people's inevitable absorption into one House or another. The scorned [[Sports and contest#duels|duelists]] and [[Sports and contest#calcio|calcio]] players, known to have a predilection towards violence. Rooks from other clans, their fracturing having left behind grudges that may never heal.

The torchbearer paladins of [[House Lightbringer]], hot on the case, discovered more than a handful of Rooks who had crept in windows or kicked in doors in search of evidence. In truth, these vigilantes like all the rest hadn't intended to interfere with the investigation. House Lightbringer was well respected, not just as a Great House but by one of the noble clans who led humanity along the Elven March just as the [[Sun Elves]] had. Even so, their efforts only served to further muddy the investigation, taint more potential crime scenes, and obscure any evidence that might have been found there.

And so when it came time for this matter to be brought before the Orators by the Houses of the Court, very little could be done to point at any possible culprit. The Houses were of course biased by their own interests and agendas, but also against each other due to their largely isolated and non-collaborative approaches to the investigation. Lengthy Court sessions continued for days and weeks, and with each the Orators and the representatives of House Lightbringer and the Silver Wolves grew more and more visibly aggregated.

Finally, it was clear that the age of cland justice had come to its necessary end. No longer was this about the crime in question. No longer was it about the culprits or the victims, themselves lost to time. And so the Orators began work to define ;aw and justice in Omphalos, the City of Gardens.

No longer were free agents granted power to deal justice on the streets of the City. The codices carved into the stone of law by the Orators during this time gave way to a new class: the [[Jurisweard]]. And these agents of the law, coming from many Houses including several of the Great Houses themselves, would come to be one of the more powerful [[Union|Unions]] and represent justice itself in matters of the Court.

The Canon of Heterodoxies cracked down on its member Houses, and law was to be dealt out only in accordance with the Jurisweard. Of course many of the Iconic Houses also joined the Jurisweard, but adequately reined in by checks and procedure for the most part.

Many of the Rookish vigilantes were persecuted for their lack of tact and role in the situation, and were persuaded to shy away from justice and in fact stick closer to the City's many shadows. Many of them and their descendants would evolve into the infamous [[Rookish clans#Rookish Cloaks|Rookish cloaks]].
