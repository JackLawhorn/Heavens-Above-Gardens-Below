An extended disaster like the [[Red Death period]] – with its [[Red Death|titular plague]] and [[Campaigns against the Red Court|campaigns]] against the [[soldiers of the Red Court|horrors]] of the [[Red Court]] – leaves behind many kinds of scars, not the least of which are the social, economic, and political troubles that immediately follow. With the human population culled and those who remain in a particularly vulnerable place, what issues and opportunities arise in the hard times after the devastation?

## Rebuilding after destruction

Of course the first thing we consider is literal, physical reconstruction: the rebuilding of the 40% of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] that was razed to the ground in the great and terrible [[Burning]]. The absence of the housing and infrastructure that used to be here alone is a major issue for the population of the City. Tens if not hundreds of thousands are displaced. More than that, the City was not built by human hands in the first place. Without the [[iconic pacts|iconic magics]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] and their [[Oremongers Guild#earth shapers|earth shapers]], how is humanity meant to approach reconstruction? How will things be different now and why?

The easiest way to show this is visually. What will grow into the [[Red Quarter]] should look different from the [[White Quarter]] and the rest of the [[Old City]]. Some combination of the materials available and symbolism; both symbolism meant for the reader and that meant for those who live in the City. This new place should be built up almost as a memorial for the lives and culture lost during the [[Red Death period]].

We should also expect the City to be equipped with [[Reconstruction#New defenses in the City|new defenses]] against the same and similar threats. These would be implemented not only in the Red Quarter but across all of the Old City.

## Shifting priorities

With great loss comes a great reframing of perspective. When we think about what could be lost in an event like this – beyond people and culture and infrastructure – we can see how humanity itself will be drastically altered going forward. Thus far, I've use much of this project to explore concepts of time and history and consequences, and deciding upon human history as the other great loss of the [[Red Death period]] just felt right. What would a people suffered to lose all of their history do going forward as a consequence of that loss? Unfortunately, we have many real world examples of this to pull on, and I'll be exploring those further.

My immediate approach, especially as I'm able to operate in a fantasy world where things are a little simpler, is to make humanity's focus on their own history significantly greater going forward. This aligns well with the prominence of scholarship and the [[College|colleges]] of the [[Scholars Quarter]], as well as humanity's reverence of the [[Sun Elves]] and their [[Griot|Griots]].

As a side effect of this, the [[House of the Sun]] – previously a very minor player I originally had a very minor plan for – is positioned to become one of the more important factions in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and really justify the idea of them as humanity's de facto ruling faction.

## Those who are left behind

40% of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] was razed to the ground in the great and terrible [[Burning]], and 60% of its population killed off by the [[Red Death]] or the [[soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]]. Where will the displaced live? Even after the City is rebuilt and population growth rises again, what damage will remain?

What was [[Red Death period City of Gardens#Enemy territory|enemy territory]], now little more than still-smoldering and storeys-tall piles of rubble, is rebuilt and comes to be known as the [[Red Quarter]]. Even as the City itself rebounds and [[New City|expands]] past the walls of the [[Old City]] throughout the [[Renascence period]], this area remains as a low place of socioeconomic inequality. From the Red Quarter grows the [[Cumbergrounds]].

Who lives here and why? Why is there no better option? How and why are the people here left behind by their neighbors and by the policies of the [[Court]]? Do things get better over time or do the issues only grow worse? What kind of culture grows among a people left behind in this way?
