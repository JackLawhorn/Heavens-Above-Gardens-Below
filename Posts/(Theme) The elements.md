## Significance

What exactly is the significance of a mythological belief in distinct "elements" like fire, water, earth, and air? If we understand mythology to be a tool used in our understanding of the world, what value does the incorporation of this idea provide?

Many of these elements can truly be seen as the building blocks of the world, not only comprising the planet itself but also describing easily distinguishable domains of the surface, ocean, and sky. In the [[Known World]] of "Heavens Above; Gardens Below" (HAGB), these concepts are extrapolated in a few different directions.

The elements can be understood as:

- Gods of unimaginable power who are the rulers of these primary domains of the world.
- The personification of these domains themselves who are completely alien to human understanding.
- The oldest inhabitants of the world from which much of its native entities have sprung.
- A people with whom forming and maintaining a relationship is a necessity for any person living upon these lands.
- The mechanism through which mages may manipulate and otherwise interact with the elements.

## Categorization

How might one attempt to categorize the elements? Different cultures include different elements in their mythologies and beliefs: earth, water, air, fire, lightning, light, dark, and even void or aether. Looking at these, some seem more similar while others seem fundamentally different. These immediate, reactionary intuitions can help us get part of the way there.

### Primary elements

In my mind, earth, water, and air are most similar to each other. They are more concrete ideas than the others, more readily understandable, and with relatively similar metaphors and symbolism surrounding them. They represent distinct regions of our world – land, sea, and sky – as well as the three primary states of matter – solid, liquid, and gas. These I've translated into the [[Mundial Aspects#Elemental motes|elemental motes]] which are alien but relatively easy to understand as animist entities.

Fire and lightning are more nebulous, and perhaps most similar to each other. To my understanding, they are both related to the state of matter known as plasma, which is less widely known and certainly less understood by the general population. They are directly tied to energy, both giving off heat and light, and have also been used in the real world as sources of energy and in other technologies. At first, I was using fire alone as the physical manifestation of magic itself, but this left a gap in my understanding of what lightning might represent. In the end, I found that using these "elements" as two distinct forms of the phenomena called magic better fit the needs of the setting. [[Nyxfire]] can be found in flames, as wielded by the [[Sun Elves]], and in bolts, as wielded by the [[Storm Elves]].

Light and dark are more obscure still. They are the only popularly recognized elements that can be seen as true opposites of one another. Not just relative opposites like fire and water are often considered to be, but true opposites with one being defined as the absence of the other. Diametrically opposed concepts that exist outside of any one world and in fact can come to represent the universe as a whole. The [[Nyx]], the personification of the night sky, is visually composed of specks of light in an ocean of darkness. These concepts, with the concept of darkness also incorporating characteristics of void or aether, are translated to the light of [[Ylem]] and the darkness of the [[Glossary/Dragon]].

### Secondary elements

There are a number of "secondary" elements such as those portrayed in Avatar the Last Airbender – often considered the peak of elemental mythology in modern fiction – that do not fit within these metaphorical and symbolic definitions. These might include sand, metal, ice, plants, and any other concepts that are realistically subsets or byproducts of the primary elements defined above.

These secondary elements, though less thematically congruous, are no less important. Regions and biomes are not made of some hypothetical pure elements of earth, water, and air, but of these secondary elements. Entire civilizations and cultures, even rudimentary maps of our world, are defined by these ideas and the boundaries between them.

Metals and gems _feel_ related to earth and are often portrayed as such. They are found in the earth or forged from those materials that are. But how do we interact with them? We're enamored with these things, they dazzle in the light (this seems thematically relevant to [[Ylem]]), they have crucial electromagnetic properties, and they capture our attention like nothing else. I've decided to make these [[docetic]] or divine materials, often related to gods or to the greater cosmology and thus from the [[Nyx]] but crashed down onto the [[Known World]].

Plants are more complicated. They aren't just _like_ living things, they _are_ living things. They might not be humanoid, which conflicts with the idea of the divine evolution of the [[Orior]] by the [[Angels]], but they shouldn't be relegated to a lesser station. They have minds of their own, reacting to stimuli and acting in their own best interest to ensure their survival. They form relationships with animal species just as the humans of this setting do. Most importantly, they feed directly on sunlight (this is definitely thematically relevant). I feel like, if they could have, the Angels would have made the [[Elven Legion|Elves]] themselves photosynthetic. In this setting, plants are plants but some, such as those in the [[Astral Wilds]] obtain enough energy from magic to be able to do more and act more autonomously. Both the [[Verdant Knights|Verdant]] and [[Reef Knights]] operate this way.

Most of the other secondary elements are relegated to the domains of the children of the [[Mundial Aspects#elemental motes|elemental motes]], the [[Mundial Aspects#motes of the landscapes|motes of the landscapes]]. They govern biomes and the materials that comprise them.

## Personifying the elements

So what exactly are the [[Mundial Aspects#elemental motes|elemental motes]] as personifications of these elements? They are clearly animist spirits, but how does that function within the setting and its cosmology? Is it a matter of matter or of energy?

### Physical mechanics

Based on my characterization of magic as energy through the idea of the [[nyxfire]] and its physical manifestations as fire and lightning, I think it's safe to say that the motes themselves represent the energies within the matter of these materials. In this way, we have elemental [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind motes]] rather than simply "air motes". The [[Mundial Aspects#water motes|water motes]] are more representations of the currents and tides than of the liquid itself. We can further extrapolate this based on science (generally a primary facet of my approach to worldbuilding).

The states of matter are distinct in the kinetic energy of their atomic components, an idea which is relatively well understood by the wider population. With more energy in air than in water and more in water than in the earth, how does this change our interpretation of the elements? Perhaps this correlates to the number or density of individual motes allotted to their domain.

These states each interact with light and sound, heat and electricity differently as well. These are all things I hope to explore eventually but which might not come out directly as pertinent details in the wider story.

### Physical manifestation

As representations of (mostly) non-physical phenomena, how can we understand the way that these [[Mundial Aspects#elemental motes|elemental motes]] might manifest into a physical form? This idea is not pertinent only to the elements but to many entities within an animist system of mythology. Thankfully, it helps that they are fairly alien and incomprehensible beings whose motives and granular mechanics of being are far beyond human understanding.

Thus enters the idea of [[formitation]], a process of physical mimicry by which [[extramundane]] beings with less-than-fully-physical forms replicate the general external shape of those they are interacting with. For a human or Elf, an elemental mote would take on a familiar and easily understandable form. So these forms are vaguely human (when seen by a human), but still [[docetic]] in nature. The outside matches an understandable form, but the inside is not comprised of atoms or molecules or organs.

Perhaps they even speak through non-physical means or through a combination of physical and psychic mechanism. Perhaps their presence has some sort of effect on the environment or natural phenomena around them. I like the idea of vibrations undulating through their forms as it feels like a more alien image.
