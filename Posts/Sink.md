Water reflects the [[Nyx]] and, of all the native elements, is the most like the Nyx itself. It ripples and undulates with powerful currents, made up of strong and often competing forces. As an ecosystem, everything nearer the surface of the Sink relies upon light from the Nyx, while the lightless depths more closely resemble the inky black heart of the [[Glossary/Dragon]] itself.

## Campaign of the Sea Elves

Just as the [[Sun Elves]] were tasked with taming the [[Wild Magics]] of the surface and the [[Storm Elves]] with eliminating the threat of the [[Giants]] of [[Giants#Empire of Dyēus|Empire of Dyēus|Dyēus]], the divine quest of the [[Sea Elves]] upon making [[nyxfall]] in the [[Known World]] was to enter the [[Sink]] and defeat the [[Lunar Aspects#<strike>The Fallen Son</strike>|Fallen Son]] that rules its depths.

From rumors and intelligence passed along by the [[Oklop]] consortiums, the [[Reef Knights]], and other allied peoples of the Sink, their presence in the undersea had a profound effect just as the Sun Elves had on the surface. The Reefs were so inspired as to evolve into a race of the [[Orior]] themselves, and it is said they learned their devotion and [[Combat Arts]] directly from these mentors. Once they delved deeper towards their true target, the Fallen Son, they were never seen again.

## The Fallen Son

> For more, see [[Fallen Son]].

After his fall into the deepest depths of the [[Sink]], the [[Lunar Aspects#<strike>The Fallen Son</strike>|Fallen Son]] was cursed to eternal slumber. Despite this, this presence has had a profound impact on the environment. No longer a [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]], his fall led him to become an [[Umbral Aspects|Umbral Aspect]] which infected the darkness of the depths and all who dwelled there. Now, his followers the [[Akụm]] inhabit the hollowed out core of his lunar form even as they still worship him as their dark [[iconic pacts|patron]].

The divine quest of the [[Sea Elves]] was to infiltrate this dark citadel and eliminate the Fallen Son as he slumbers.
