## Transition to a culture of Houseship

The decline of [[cland]] culture began as early as the [[Later Heliotropic Age]] in a still-young [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. With the founding of the [[Court]] and the [[Naming of the Great Houses|naming]] of its [[Great House|Great Houses]], many of the [[human clans]] began to vie for [[House|Houseship]]. This transition towards a culture of Houseship began long before the cland peoples began to face any persecution.

The newly formed Houses were afforded representation in matters of the Court, a say in the development of this new home for all of humanity. Houseship was also the primary mechanism through which the populace of the City were able to organize, forge lucrative relationships, and acquire capital.

Most Houses were still monoethnic through the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]], their members tied together by a shared clanship or perhaps comprised of multiple, complementary clans constellated together.

## Losses of the Red Death period

With the losses of the [[Red Death period]], the influence of the [[human clans]] were largely lost. The survivors who gathered in the [[Barony of Stilts]] formed cultures of their own apart from any [[cland]] identity. As of the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], all but a few clans – namely [[Clan Wolfstepper]] and some of the [[Rookish clans]] – have constellated and now one would instead trace their life and lineage based on patron [[House|Houses]].

Houses of the [[Court]] became the backbone of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and integral to life there. One's place of birth, home, education, industry, and other opportunities are largely dictated by the House they are born into or move to.

## Persecution of cland peoples

The persecution of [[cland]] peoples began in earnest with the [[fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of the [[Silver Wolves]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], after which [[Clan Wolfstepper]] was made to suffer the consequences for the betrayal of the [[New Silver Age]]. As punishment, the clan's stores of [[silver]] were seized by the rest of humanity and split into smaller and smaller pieces such that it could never be retrieved in full again. Later, in the [[Early Renascence period]], they were sequestered by the [[House of the Sun]] and their [[Court]] within the walls of the [[Argent Ghetto]].

After the dramatic downfall of Clan Wolfstepper at the hands of a humanity that had largely [[#Transition to a culture of Houseship|transitioned]] to a culture of [[House|Houseship]], the remaining cland peoples started to fear that similar fates awaited them. Widespread distain for the few remnants of [[Old World]] culture that remained in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] led to growing persecution – first quiet and then open. Even decades later, it was as if the past was haunted by the [[Crisis of Hubris]] and humanity found itself lashing out at the [[Human clans|clans]] as if they too had [[Fallen Houses|fallen]].

Those who fled that persecution constellated under the banner of the [[Wayfarers Guild]] and traveled north in their caravans further into the [[Old World continent]]. There, they founded a number of [[Wayfarer colonies|colonies]] that by the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]] have become foundational to the greater [[Republic]].
