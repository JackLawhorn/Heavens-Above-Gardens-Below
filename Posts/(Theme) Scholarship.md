## Categorizing fields of scholarship

### The Objective and the Subjective

The concept of [[the Objective]] and [[the Subjective]] is based on my own experiences in education and academia. Fields – especially the scientific fields – are eager to lump each other into rather arbitrary groupings labeled as either "soft" and "hard", or perhaps the sciences themselves versus the dreaded "humanities".

This leads to something resembling low-level faction warfare between the students, teachers, and professionals of different disciplines. All based on glaringly arbitrary and reductive ideas and metrics of objectivity. Physics claims to be a hard science, nearing perfect objectivity, and turns up its nose at, for example, biology. Below even biology are the real soft sciences or, god forbid, even something as lowly and subjective as psychology.

But these claims are ridiculous as anyone not already entrenched in this system should be able to deduce immediately. How is physics, of which we know little and can be sure of even less, a harder science than say computer science? The former we believe to operate completely differently than we currently understand elsewhere in the universe. Gravity, for example, we know not the cause of but are sure it works in reverse in the outer edges of our perceived reality. Meanwhile, the former is built on layers over layers of technologies we ourselves invented. What more objective field can there be than a series of ones and zeroes capable of describing anything imaginable?

Through the idea of the Objective versus the Subjective in this setting, I've attempted to challenge these preconceived notions. Under this dualist system, the material sciences are Objective, as is the field of mathematics, but so is psychology (at least according to the [[Psionics College]]). Perhaps its more accurate to label and group these fields by the following distinction: do they deal in simple or complex problems?

### The source of knowledge

Just like my approach to categorizing the many magic systems of this setting, I think it's important to consider the source of the knowledge itself.

The fields comprising [[the Objective]] handle largely observable phenomena and our understanding of them comes from those observations. Biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, psychology; these fields study phenomena that occur regardless of having been observed.

On the other hand, the fields comprising [[the Subjective]] are productive, not observational. They deal with phenomena that do not exist outside of our observation of them. The arts are a productive field, in many ways an output based on the input of our experiences. Philosophy does not simply concern itself with _how_ we think like psychology might, but rather thinking with intent, thinking about thinking and learning to think better. History? History falls under the Subjective as well. It is not the mechanism of time passing and the events that occur, it is the mechanism of our own understanding of that time and of those events.

## Ways of pursuing scholarship

In today's world, at least here in the United States, scholarship is often exclusively expressed through formal institutions like colleges, universities, and special interest groups. The people are palpably rebelling against this system, and it seems like I'm always hearing more and more people talk about different types of institutions and new opportunities for education. If we look to the past, we see that things used to be very different. Great amphitheaters where free, public education was readily accessible. Even individual scholars and academics wandering the streets in search of hidden truths inspired by their environment and the rapidly changing realities of human life.

I want to embrace this in this setting. I have colleges and universities, yes. But I also want the streets of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] to be home to wandering philosophers, great bards and artists sculpting the very City itself one street or sculpture or wall relief at a time, and genius mathematicians living on the streets who are thought to be mad until they reveal their findings to the rest of humanity. I want to recall the great exploratory expeditions of the past. I want to give academics and scholars the political, social, and cultural power to receive charters for such expeditions and the resources needed to complete them. I want scholarly factions to wax and wane like dynasties.

And I think all this is perfectly reasonable to expect from the world I've been building. Imagine a humanity who is forced to contend with a complete lack of understanding about their world. Where forces are capable of bending the fabric of reality itself. And this whole journey starts with an alien race landing on their world claiming divine knowledge and offering to impart it upon this lesser people. So what happens once the humans finally have a city of their own and are without the guidance of the Elves? Sure the motivations must start and end with power, I think the [[Materialists College|Materialists]] and [[Psionics College|Psionics Colleges]] play that role well enough. But that should not and cannot be the end of it. There has to be more, more to learn and more of a need for humanity to learn about their world for reasons beyond the simple attainment of power.
