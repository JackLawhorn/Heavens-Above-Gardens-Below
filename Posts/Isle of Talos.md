The Isle of Talos is a small [[Isles of the Great Sea|isle]] of the [[Great Sea]] and the second to be settled by humanity – specifically, the predecessors of [[House Talos]] before its founding who came there to escape the ramifications of their connections to the [[First Vergonic Church]] during the [[Vergonic War]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. It is best known as the origin of the [[simulacra]], who have developed entire cultures within its gardens.

## Workshops of House Talos

For centuries, the founders of the [[Isles of the Great Sea|isle]] worked – sequestered in their workshops – on their great [[Great Works|Scientific Works]]: the [[simulacra]] with which they rose to prominence and gained [[House|Houseship]]. These workshops are a maze of tools and raw material, with piles of silver gears and coils of copper wiring placed seemingly haphazardly. There are early prototypes as old as the settlement itself standing eternally at attention next to the newest models that still remain works in progress.

The only sounds that fill these halls are the echoing spirits of craftsmen, their walls cracked and pierced by the roots of climbing vines. The dust in the air makes visible the light of [[Ylem]] through high windows. In truth, no human eyes have seen the leaders or stewards of [[House Talos]] in multiple generations.

## Gardens of Simulacra

It is said that around the [[#Workshops of House Talos|workshops]] of [[House Talos]] are gardens the likes of which humanity has never seen, gardens that rival those of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] itself. And those gardens, it is said, are populated not by beasts or any living creatures but by the [[simulacra]] themselves.

Over centuries, the [[near-life]] machines – left entirely to their devices by their masters – have developed entire cultures comprised of distinct models of various shapes, sizes, and talents. At some point along this evolution, they reached self-sufficiency: maintaining and repairing themselves and even producing entirely new lines of machines.

They tend to the [[Isles of the Great Sea|isle]]'s gardens just as they tend to themselves, effectively counteracting the pollution inflicted by their own manufacturing. They have promoted verdancy and growth where previously there was none. They have forged relationships with the [[Mundial Aspects#elemental motes|elemental motes]] such that humanity has not been able to since the [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall ]]of the [[Oremongers Guild]] in the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]].
