Life – as it is understood by humanity and their scholars – is the result of a complex reaction of [[albedo]] within the intersection of the [[Standard Elven Cosmology|Spheres]] defined by the overlap of the [[Prime Material Sphere]] and the [[Astral Sphere]]. The specifics of that formula are known only to the [[Angels]] themselves, who engineered life throughout the [[Nyx]] as a powerful weapon against their enemy: the [[Dragon]]. Systems and mechanisms that approach but do not perfectly replicate this phenomena are called "near-life".

Some examples are expressly malignant, engineered by bad actors in the [[Known World]] such as the [[Red Court]] whose [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] are near-life. Others are benign, such as the [[simulacra]] of [[House Talos]], but may still be met with skepticism and suspicion as forbidden knowledge nearing [[paradoxy]].

## Prominent examples
