Developed by [[House Talos]] from their [[isles of the Great Sea|isle]] on the [[Great Sea]] sometime in the [[Early Renascence period|Early]]-to-Mid [[Renascence|Renascence period]], the simulacra (singular *simulacrum*) are [[near-life]] machines that mimic the generation and flow of [[albedo]] throughout the anatomy of living creatures.

## Mechanisms of the simulacra

The simulacra are unique among [[near-life]] in the [[Known World]]: created by the power of the sciences rather than the [[magics in the Known World|magics]]. They are humanity's greatest [[Great Works|Scientific Works]]. The first prototypes were constructs of [[silver]] gears plated in oven-baked clay. The turning of the gears generated [[albedo]] which – as if with a mind of its own – made hasty connections and pathways that produced stilted movement. This phenomena is considered a form of [[near-life]] and is integral to.

This mechanism would be consolidated into the heart of the simulacrum, from which albedo flowed through coiled copper wire to animate bones of steel. Their clay housing gave way to stone and to steel. Later designs would move away from such primitive mechanisms to use the steam engine developed in the [[Early Post-Enlightenment Era]] and eventually the [[nyxfire engines]] of the [[Later Post-Enlightenment Era]].

These improvements not only generated albedo much more efficiently, but optimized its flow to maximize the accuracy, mobility, and reflexes of the simulacra. 

## Simulacra in the Known World

Today, the simulacra are a common sight throughout the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] of the [[Questing Houses]], in every major [[House]], and in the homes of their [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]]. They are manufactured on the [[Isle of Talos]] and transported by the [[Shipwrights Guild]] whose vessels cross back and forth between the [[isles of the Great Sea|isles]] and shores of the [[Great Sea]].

### Cheap labor

The simulacra are seen as tools first and foremost, and their primary use as are a means of cheap labor. The machines are purchased for a small fortune but do not require food and water nor wages. It was the labor models who dug and paved the roads from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] to the [[Wayfarer colonies]] of the [[Old World continent]], who forged the path along the [[Sun Coast]], and who now build the newest [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] of the [[Republic]] in the [[lands to the south]].

Cheaper models serve the [[Orator]] and the [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] of the [[Court]] as servants, petty trifles to be shown off and made to do menial work. These models are a common sight throughout the Republic.

### War machines on the frontlines

In the campaigns of the [[Later Post-Enlightenment Era]] and beyond, simulacra will bolster the ranks of human warriors as war machines on the frontlines of our battles. They are stronger and sturdier and will eventually be faster. Their battalions can more easily be transported over long distances. They can be armed with powerful [[nyxfire engines]] and weapons like the [[Helios suncaster]] that humans are unable to wield.

Indeed, if humanity is to join the [[roiling of the Nyx]], we will most likely do so on the back of these war simulacra or use them to fight as our proxies.

### In the gardens of House Talos

The existence of the simulacra is reliant on humanity: both their creators and their masters. Only on the [[Isle of Talos]] do they have the opportunity to exist free from masters and have what we might call lives. During the [[Renascence]], entire cultures of these machines developed in the [[Isles of the Great Sea|isle]]'s [[Isle of Talos#Gardens of Simulacra|gardens]] where – free from limitation and influence – they eventually became self-sustaining and self-replicating.
