*What am I doing here?* thinks the scholar. *This isn't right.*

As if suddenly waking from a daze, the deadly gravity of his situation dawns on him. They are some blocks across the [[Red Death period City of Gardens#The warding line|warding line]] and into [[Red Death period City of Gardens#Enemy territory|enemy territory]]. Looking around him, the other members of his party do not seem to notice his wavering. They continue forward into the dark, slowly and quietly as to not alert the [[soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] that have infested this place.

The party was small. Small enough, at least, to maximize their chances. If any of them gave names before they crossed into this accursed place, he could not recall. Ahead and to his left, hugging the wall of this narrow walkway between [[Gardens of the City|gardens]], are a [[Apotropaics#Berserkers of the Red Moon|Berserker]] of the [[Red Moon]] – an elite [[Apotropaics|Apotropaic]] of [[Clan Wolfstepper]] – and a [[Apotropaics#Torchbearer's Purifier clerics|Purifier]] of the [[House of the Sun]] – leading the party with a lit torch in one hand and an as-of-yet unlit flint-striker blade in the other.

"Brother," whispers the [[Rookish clans|Rookish]] [[Apotropaics#Rookish chanticleers|chanticleer]] to his right, both fists armed with [[Rookish clans#talons|talons]]. With a touch to the shoulder, they startle him back to awareness. They motion for him to join them closer to the opposite wall to the right. He cannot recall from which of the Rookish clans they hail, and it is too dark here to make out the colors of their [[Rookish clans#visage|visage]] and [[Rookish clans#bird-hamir|bird-hamir]].

*What am I doing here?* he thinks again after thanking them silently.

His companions are warriors, true Apotropaics. What has he to offer as a scholar? His [[Materialists College]] had failed so completely to find a solution to the problem that was the [[Red Death]] or to the soldiers of the Red Court. His own [[Materialist magics|materialist]] magics, enchanted within his staff and belt of trinkets and bobbles, grant minor [[extramundane]] properties but cannot make him a warrior.

This place *feels* wrong. The divine light of [[Ylem]] cast by the [[Elven Signaltower]] is so close above them. Its [[nyxfire]] flame has burned for months straight: a [[Long Daylight]] illuminating all of the [[Known World]]. Another shameful failure of his [[College]]. Rather than end the threat of the Red Court, who were vulnerable to the light, it only served to deepen the shadows here in the outskirts of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

Here, the shadows themselves move. They are substantial and hungry, as if they might envelope and consume them at any moment. And in this darkness, the enemy had been able to thrive and multiply and further entrench themselves within this place where they should not have been. Sounds echo between these walls. Sounds of the battles with this enemy, the screams of their victims, and the [[Rookish clans#birdsong|birdsong]] of rooks flitting across the rooftops.

Then, the sound of something much closer. His companions all halt their progress without communicating and he follows suit out of a freezing terror rather than out of any warrior's instinct.

It sounds unnatural, but then everything about this enemy is deeply unnatural. A wet, visceral squelching. The soft padding of hands and feet – altogether too many to be human – against stone. This is not the worst of them, not the more evolved of their soldiers, they could be sure of that. Those are too quick to hear coming.

After what seems like an eternity, a shape begins to form in the darkness just beyond the light of the Purifier's flame and stops there. It's hard to make out, but the rest had seen horrors such as this. Even the scholar had heard the stories of those who survived to tell them. A [[Soldiers of the Red Court#Shambling Mounds|Shambling Mound]].

These abominations may not be as fatally efficient as the others, but this sight inflicted the party with another kind of fear. A more visceral fear. Slowly, he begins to make out additional details of this shape in the dark. Dozens of appendages extruding from the mass at unnatural angles. The silhouettes of heads, at least four, some of which open and close rhythmically along long, vertical seems.

And the voices. The mouths emit a chorus of guttural noise, like the thing that has infected and overcome these people is learning to speak through them. Hundreds of thousands had died – and he had seen to the wounds of thousands more survivors of these things – but the noise was worse than it all. Worse than anything he had ever seen or heard or felt.

The cleric moves as if to approach the enemy, but is stopped by a hand on her shoulder. The Berserker. He approaches slowly and quietly, a silver sword in one hand and a short blade in the other. The Shambling Mound will not enter into the light, nor is it quick enough to escape a child of the [[Lunar Aspects#Wolf Mother|Wolf Mother]]. It happens impossibly fast. The Berserker pounces, shifting to the form of a wolf in mid-air. When he shifts back to human form, his [[Docetic materials#silver|silver]] blades have sliced the enemy in twain.

Perhaps their greatest weakness – even here in the shadows where the light of Ylem cannot reach them – the silver melts through accursed and half-rotted flesh without resistance. A scholar of the Materialists College, it is hard not to admire the phenomenon at work: the [[albedo]] of the [[Docetic materials|docetic material]] is almost like hard light itself. The substantial chunks of the now-dead thing burst into quick flashes of flames before the hungry shadows move back in to envelope it.

But the Berserker does not step back into the light of the torch. The scholar already knows what will happen next, but it is too late.

"Brother?" whispers the Purifier cleric after a moment, "Brother are you the--"

The [[Soldiers of the Red Court#Apex Vector|Apex Vector]] is upon her before the words leave her mouth, nothing more than a flash of bloody red flesh before the torch is extinguished. Without it's light, the two remaining party members are submerged in the all-encompassing darkness of the [[Shades]].

At first, the scholar hears nothing, as if the shadows have swallowed up the sound along with the light. The silence is broken, however by a call from above. The voice is that of his rookish companion who yells, "Retreat comrade!"

Without their [[Rookish clans#Raptor eyes|raptor eyes]], he cannot see in this dark, cannot see the threat coming. Pings of metal on stone to his left. Throwing blades? A blood curdling roar from the infected beast.

And suddenly, the alleyway is once again illuminated; the spot where the Purifier had fallen drenched in sticky flames. Screams come from underneath them. Apparently, the cleric had some fight left in her after all. The scholar had heard rumors of the zealots self immolating circulating through the camps of the survivors back across the warding line. In the heart of the flames, the [[labrum]] of their [[Fall of House Lightbringer|fallen]] Captain Torchbearer is the last thing to burn. It did not protect her devoted this night.

The Apex Vector rears back on its hind legs but is quickly incinerated by the flames. In their light, the scholar sees the rook, on the ground wounded and propping themselves up against the wall.

Before the two have time to recover, dark flashes leap between rooftops above their heads. Sure that it is a hunting party of Apex Vectors, the scholar prepares the the end. But down comes a familiar sound: the wooden sounds of the [[Apotropaics#Cardinals and the Rattlewatch|Rattlewatch]] and their alarms.

"Comrades," yells one of the [[cardinals]], "retreat back to the warding line!"

"We were already on our way," responds the scholar's own rookish companion.

"It's an all out retreat," the messenger respond even as he flits away, "a final offensive is being launched on the enemy! The [[nyxfire motes]]! They've given us only minutes to recall our forces!"

*The nyxfire motes?* thinks the scholar, his eyes widening with the realization. *Had it finally come to this?*

"They're going to raze the City!" he shouted. "Come on!"

Most of the retreat is a blur. Parties meet at intersections, growing their numbers briefly before the Shambling Mounds and the Apex Vectors and all the soldiers of the Red Court descend upon them and whittle them back down. The scholar keeps his head down. He doesn't look back towards the screams of his comrades no matter how close they sound.

After some time, he feels a warmth. Lifting his head, he sees that the warding line is within sight. The crowd has begun following along the wall towards the crossing at the river [[Torrente]], the watch atop it casting beams of light down to cover their retreat. For the first time, he allows himself to look back. His rookish companion is nowhere to be found. Maybe they made it through. He never learned their name.

He's maybe halfway there when he notices something in the dark. The glint of eyes – human eyes – a ways away from the wall. A spotlight briefly illuminates the spot, revealing for a moment a small child. Afraid and alone.

It's as if the full weight of this night – this damned night – and of this entire accursed war hits the scholar at the sight. He's lost everything. His people has lost everything. The dead undoubtably measure in the hundreds of thousands. Too many lost in the weeks and months before they truly understood the threat. This City of Gardens is now nothing more than a City of Graves.

And then there was this child.

*He isn't far*, he thinks as if all sense has left him. The crowd had all but disappeared, gone ahead to the river and back to the safety just across the line. And he had no way of knowing how soon the street he stood on now would be turned to rubble. How soon the buildings around him would turn molten in the pure nyxfire flames of the Signaltower.

And then, before he realizes what he's done, he is halfway to the child and away from the safety of the warding line. As he reaches the child, he envelopes them in his scholar's cloak and – without a word – carries them back to the line and then towards the river. This sprint too is a blur.

They barely manage to make the crossing before it starts.

Omphalos, the City of Gardens – already drenched in the same daylight it's seen for months now – becomes saturated in *bright* in an instant. All of humanity looks up at once to see a thin line of pure white light now shoots from the top of the Elven Signaltower. None see where the beam makes impact, but it is followed in quick succession by powerful tremors shot through the earth, a deafening sound like the clap of a thunder, and then a great heat.

The light of the Signaltower itself has dimmed by this exertion of power, but the Known World grew no less bright. The flames of this great and terrible [[Burning]] reach taller than the City's towers and [[roccas]]. Their harsh light makes them difficult to look at, but they take the form of [[formitation|motes]] walking through the blast zone and spreading destruction in their wake. They can be seen from the [[Nyx]].

The scholar of the Materialists College looks upon this and comes to the same conclusion as the rest of humanity: the Known World has been changed forever. Looking down at the child – still in his arms – he thinks to himself, *all has not been lost*.
