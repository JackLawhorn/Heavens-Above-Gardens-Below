## Death whistles

Perhaps the most ghoulish of the tools of the [[necromancer demons]] are the whistles of their [[necromancer demons#death squads|death squads]]. Each is painstakingly carved from stone and cherry and dark magics by their owners, and holds within it a chunk of flesh: the vocal chords of some poor victim. Etched within the accursed raw material are the screams the demons themselves bore from their prey as they eradicated them, and through their [[necromancy]] those same sounds emanate from the death whistles when blown.

The death squads – on their hunts far from the shores of the [[Isle of Melos]] – use such tools either to terrorize or to lure their prey. The death whistles are prized for their effectiveness in  both use cases.

## Devil's cleavers

Even today – in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]] when such arms have been made near obsolete by the [[Blackpowder Guild]] and their weapons of war – the [[necromancer demons]] are known to wield bladed weapons known only as *devil's cleavers*. Combining all their knowledge in the realms of [[materialist magics]] and [[necromancy]], these tools have been carved from wood petrified by prolonged exposure the [[nyxfire]] storms of the [[Wild Magics]].

This material is hard as stone and contains materialist magics that allow the wielders of the devil's cleavers to slice and bisect and chop limb from torso without severing the all-important pathways through which [[albedo]] flows through the anatomy. This unique attribute makes them particularly important to the [[necromancer devils]] who seek to claim these parts for themselves through the dark practice of [[necromantic grafts]].
