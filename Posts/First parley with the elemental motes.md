As the [[Elven March]] came across the [[Great Delta]] in their journey down the [[Gold Coast]], humanity made their first contact with the [[Mundial Aspects#elemental motes|elemental motes]], facilitated by their mentors the [[Sun Elves]]. Here, a great river from the east broke out into the [[Sink]], a perfect battleground for the ongoing conflict known as the [[roiling of the elements]]. But as the Elves approached and the nearby [[Wild Magics]] were tamed, this roiling dissolved into a temporary peace.

Wanting the humans to meet these [[Ylem]], these [[Mundial Aspects]], the Elves called for a parley. The [[Elven Legion|Legion]] made camp there and all of the [[human clans]] – down to those in the rear of the March – arrived to see and touch and speak with the wonders of the elements.

It is said that the Sun Elves were puzzled by some obscure characteristic of the waterway, asked the [[Mundial Aspects#Motes of the landscapes|motes of the river]] of its source, and were told of the [[Aspect]] called [[Sobek (Minor Aspect)|Sobek]] who had come out of the [[nyxfire]] storms of the Wild Magics and whose trail of tears had laid down this river. Knowing the humans were safe with these protectors, the Legion marched east to dispatch this newfound threat. ^0c7414

So great was the number of the motes that it looked as though the world itself was alive, and indeed it was. The motes were their domains made manifest, taking on a form mimicking that of their guests so as to be familiar to them. From the dirt and the stone and the delta's sand rose the [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth motes]]. From the waters of the sea and of this great river and of the brackish waters of the delta rose the [[Mundial Aspects#water motes|water motes]]. And from the many furies of the sky both above the land and above the waves of the Sink came down the [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind motes]].

In the care of the motes for five days, early humanity learned from and about the keepers of the [[Known World]]. They learned how to live in and with the world, and how they might worship her. They learned the secrets of promoting verdancy and growth, what would later become agriculture. They learned how they might know one land or one body of water from another, what was free for them to use and what was the domain of the Aspects alone.

The earth motes taught them so that they might make dyes, and the human clans would come to be known by the colors of the clothes they made there. The water motes taught them the buoyancy of wood from that of stone so that one day they might march across the Sink itself. And the wind motes taught them the call of a bad wind from that of a good wind so that they might divine the weather of the days ahead.

And on the fifth day, the [[nyxfire motes]] themselves arrived, their bolts raining down like a bevy of spears. They flickered and pulsed and breathed like any other flame, but the humans knew from the Elves that these were beings of true divinity. They explained that they were distant yet direct descendants of the light of Ylem itself, and of a greater divinity than even the [[Major Aspects]]. Born of the [[Angels]], of the pure nyxfire bound within their amor of stone, the nyxfire motes are [[nyxfarer|nyxfarers]] at heart and each have traveled far across the Nyx to reach this world. From these motes the human clans learned the esoteric truths: secrets of [[roiling of the Nyx]] and the [[Old World]] and the [[fallen world|fall]].

When the Sun Elves returned – solemn for the blood of Sobek was on their hands – the human clans had been forever changed. The world they had feared for millennia of prehistory had opened up to them, and they knew more now about the elements and about themselves than they had ever hoped to.

Our people were, arguably, wiser than we shall ever be again. There were secrets lost in the [[Red Plague]] and the [[Burning]] that ended it, that were not recovered in [[Reconstruction]]. These secrets have not been recounted by the motes since, for the [[fall of the Oremongers Guild]] and their [[paradoxy]] against the [[Nyx]] severed these ties forever.
