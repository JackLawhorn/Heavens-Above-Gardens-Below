## Soft magic versus hard magic systems

The question of soft versus hard magic systems is often considered an early and key step in the fantasy worldbuilding process. Choosing one or the other largely sets the tone and level of realism for a world. I found that I wanted to explore both perspectives and that the interplay between both in the same world could thematically align with certain other ideas I wanted to pursue.

The [[Known World]] is a world in transition and seeing constant development. I'm trying to write [[Ages of the Known World|ages]] worth of history, over which much of the ideas that are there at the start either die out or transform into something else entirely. What better set of magic systems to align with that tone and theme than a mix of competing soft and hard systems, soft systems that are later recontextualized as hard systems, and hard systems that are recontextualized as fields of science instead of magic in the first place?

Instead of individual systems at all, I largely went for sweeping umbrella classes of magics that could be called soft or hard. [[Organic magics]] and [[pact magics]] are soft systems, but their mechanics have a sheen of hard magic in them that allow them to feed into more scientific-feeling fields like [[materialist magics]] or [[Combat Arts]] or [[Hexecraft pacts|hexecraft]]. [[Psionics]] is a science or perhaps a hard magic system so formalized it appears as such. This approach gives me the ability to define new organic magics and pacts that might lean more towards one direction that another and I've really enjoyed that freedom.

## Hard magic versus science

As things lean further in the direction of a hard magic system, it also approaches something that looks an awful lot like a field of science rather than a kind of magic at all. Hard magic systems have formal and understandable components and mechanics that yield results that can be reproduced. They can often be classified into their own distinct subfields that mages are able to specialize in over others.

Beyond their mechanical and aesthetic similarities, there are of course a number of thematic elements to consider. What are the politics of a field being classified as a hard magic system versus simply a mundane field of science? We might be able to find a parallel in the debate between science and real-world religion. Though not a perfect analogy, the historic fight between creationism and evolution shows that a phenomenon can be understood through both mundane and [[extramundane]] means, or even a mixture of the two. Differences of opinion in areas as personal as this can easily be politicized and debate can devolve into spite and vitriol.

I try to explore this in a number of different areas. The [[Materialists College]] and the [[necromancer demons]] they became were scholars and scientists at heart, who learned such powerful secrets from an objective perspective. The field of [[psionics]] in particular is a major battleground for this debate, with the [[mystic psionics]] of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] giving way to the more scientific perspective of the [[Psionics College]]. Both fields have [[Great House|Great Houses]] as their biggest proponents, factions who then [[Fallen Houses|fall]] during the [[Crisis of Hubris]] and are transformed into something very different by that experience.
