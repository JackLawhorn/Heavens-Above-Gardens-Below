The nyxfire motes are not native to the [[Known World]], but individual sparks of the ever-burning [[Ylem]] come to this world after millennia floating through the [[Nyx]]. Even these small flickerings possess immense magics and a modicum of divinity, greater even than the [[Major Aspects]].

## Docetic form

These motes are more ethereal like the elemental [[Mundial Aspects#wind motes|wind motes]] rather than the more substantial form of the [[Mundial Aspects#earth motes|earth]] or [[Mundial Aspects#water motes|water motes]]. They manifest in two primary forms: as the cleansing [[nyxfire]] flames or as the booming nyxfire bolts. A single mote can be considered as the [[monad]] to the greater [[legion]] that [[Ylem]]. Having traveled far through the cold void of the [[Nyx]], their power is limited compared to that of the [[Angels]] who wield the flames of Ylem with greater intent and conviction.

## Culture

The nyxfire motes are [[Nyxfarer|nyxfarers]] by nature, not [[Elven March|Marching]] like the [[Elven Legion]] but shooting from world to world through the [[Nyx]] itself. They are cut off from the whole, but are divine mystics and guardians of the purest magics of reality. They serve as watchers on in the [[Known World]], generally taking on a passive role.

In [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the nyxfire motes burn atop the great [[Elven Signaltower]], marking the Known World and its position in the Nyx. In the skies above, they rumble and strike in the form of bolts, allied with the [[Storm Elves]] against the Giants and their terrible [[Giants#Empire of Dyēus|Empire of Dyēus]].

## Summoning nyxfire motes

Nyxfire motes do not form [[iconic pacts]] with others, but can be summoned by those with whom they have formed close relationships. Few are adept at summoning flames without the need to perform rituals. They are most amenable to the [[Elven Legion|Elves]], and are readily summoned by the [[Sun Elves]] and [[Storm Elves]] in their flame and bolt forms respectively. [[Clans Lightbringer and Torchbearer]], who were closest to the Sun Elves along the [[Elven March]], were the sole other people capable of summoning even sparks.

Instead, humans and the other races of the [[Orior]] can summon diluted, non-magical flames through a number of mundane rituals such as striking metal against flint. In later [[Ages of the Known World|ages]], the summoning of fire and lightning through industrialized processes is common as a method of generating power. For example, through steam engines, coal engines, or friction engines.

There is but one terrible exception to this rule. In the [[Red Death period]] of the [[Crisis of Hubris]], the [[Red Death|titular plague]] would be put to an end by the [[House of the Sun#Daywatch|Daywatch]] of the [[House of the Sun]] by unleashing a great [[Burning]] onto [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Though this succeeded in defeating the [[Red Court]], the nyxfire motes of the [[Elven Signaltower]] warned that the its great power was not without limit. It is unknown how many times this ultimate power can be unleashed, or if it can ever be unleashed again.
