The necromancer demons are the remnants of the [[Materialists College]] [[Fall of the Materialists College#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exiled]] from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], now predominantly based out of their colony on the [[Isle of Melos]]. Originally named *demons* by the [[Triumph of the Sobek|Triumph]] of the [[Sobek]] – a word from their [[pre-contact]] language used to describe the [[Bouda cackles]] and others who practice the dark art of [[necromancy]] – whose accusations brought about their [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]], these first human necromancers would largely adopt and embrace this name.

## Quests of the demons

Necromancer demons stalk the races of the [[noble beasts]] and the [[Orior]], hunters seeking out their prey to take their [[organic magics]] for themselves. The raw materials they rend from their victims serve to further a number of [[Quest|quests]] which they pursue both at home on the [[Isle of Melos]] and in the wider [[Known World]]. Scholars by nature, their prime directive is to pursue complete understanding and mastery of the [[Magics in the Known World|field of magics]] known as [[necromancy]], just as they had within the halls of the [[Materialists College]] in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

Others purely seek the power that this field of study offer, producing increasingly potent necromantic artifacts and [[necromantic grafts|grafts]]. It was this obsession that led to the birth of the first [[necromancer devils]] and the [[Necromancer Archdevils|Archdevils]].

### Hunt for the Red Court

At the dawn of the [[Renascence period]], the demons of [[Isle of Melos|Melos]] would become consumed with a new [[quest]]: the execution of the [[Red Court]] and its allies. Now armed with powerful [[Necromancy|necromantic]] artifacts and later the macabre [[necromantic grafts|grafts]] of their [[devils]], they ventured out into the [[Known World]] in search of their new prey.

## Classes of demons

### Necroscholars

The necroscholars dissect and experiment on the remains of the [[noble beasts]] and other races of the [[Orior]], holed away in the hills of [[Isle of Melos|Melos]]. They are the true heirs to the legacy of the [[Materialists College]], seeking an understanding of the [[Magics in the Known World|magics]] of the [[Known World]] even after [[Fall of the Materialists College#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exile]] from their home in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

The stores of the four [[Isle of Melos#Unholy Reliquaries|Unholy Reliquaries]] there are stocked, each specimen labeled according to the [[organic magics]] they possessed in life, the [[materialist magics]] the material holds in death, the ease with which this power can be accessed by their ranks, and suitability for preservation as artifacts or use for [[Necromancy|necromantic]] [[necromantic grafts|grafts]]. It was the necroscholars who developed these techniques and gave rise to the [[devils]] and later the [[Necromancer Archdevils|Archdevils]].

### Death squads

The necromancer demons are most infamous for their death squads which, as far back as the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]], hunted the races of the [[noble beasts]] and the [[Orior]] to take their [[organic magics]] for themselves. It was these crimes that brought about the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]] of the [[Materialists College]], and led to their [[Fall of the Materialists College#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exile]] from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

Now, in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]], the death squads of the necromancer demons are armed with both powerful [[necromancy]] and other [[materialist magics]], as well as the deadly firearms purchased from the [[Blackpowder Guild]]. Though typically not made up of [[necromancer devils|devils]], the death squads are some of the strongest warriors in the [[Known World]] as they are each equipped with several necromantic artifacts that afford them powerful magics in their battles against their prey.

Their hunts serve to provide the raw material that stocks the four [[Isle of Melos#Unholy Reliquaries|Unholy Reliquaries]], enables the experiments of the [[#Necroscholars]], and ultimately become necromantic artifacts or [[necromantic grafts|grafts]].

### Necromancer devils

> For more, see [[Necromancer devils]].

[[Necromancer devils|Devils]] are necromancers of great power, distinguished from their brethren by their great will and sacrifice in the pursuit of greater magics. Their physical forms are monstrous, enhanced by sometimes fatal [[necromantic grafts]] made from the remains of the races of the [[noble beasts]] and the [[Orior]] hunted down by their [[#death squads]]. In return, they have become forces of nature just as much as they are the product of dangerous and immoral techno-magical advancement.

To the devils, taking on a graft is to be augmented, to be approved. It is a spiritual experience that drastically and permanently alters not only one's physical form but also the spirit as it alters the flow of [[albedo]] through the [[aura]]. Unlike with simple [[necromantic]] artifacts, the grafts and their magics are gained permanently. As such, each devil has hunted down and prepared the raw material used in their own grafts.

### Necromancer Archdevils

> For more, see [[Necromancer Archdevils]].

The [[Necromancer Archdevils|Archdevils]] are [[necromancer devils]] elevated to the power of the [[Umbral Aspects]] themselves, bathed in blood and battle-tested. Often warped by multiple [[necromantic grafts]], the Archdevils ascend by destroying a [[Minor Aspects|Minor Aspect]] of [[Ylem]] in one-on-one combat and – in doing so – become as Umbral Aspects themselves. The meager ranks of these horrific warrior scholars, who currently number only four, lead the [[Isle of Melos#demons of Melos|demons of Melos]].
