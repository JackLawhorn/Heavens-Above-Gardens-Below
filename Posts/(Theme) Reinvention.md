## Elves

The [[Elven Legion]] is the first real concept I started this project with. I've never really found Elves particularly engaging in any fantasy setting I've come across. Their holier than thou demeanor, their relative homogeneity, even their advanced connections to the magics of their respective settings simply aren't attractive to me.

I didn't necessarily want to exclude them from this setting – they are mainstays of the genre after all – and so I needed to find a way to incorporate them in a way that _did_ interest me despite these perceived flaws. My approach to this was to use them as a starting point for the entire setting, and in doing so ensure that they at least were something I was proud of and more engaging than I usually found them.

They're holier than thou demeanor I've interpreted as a literal, objective superiority – a product of their closeness to the [[Angels]] and the purposefulness of their existence – which is balanced by a willingness to mentor the vulnerable, fledgling humanity. Their homogeneity I've made a feature rather than a bug, making them something like the bioengineered space marines of Warhammer 40K. And as a result, their advanced connection to the magics are offset by real, tangible weaknesses.

### Inspiration

- Space Marines in Warhammer 40K
- The clone armies in Star Wars
- The pillar men of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 2
- Archetypical Musou warriors across fiction
- Many muscle-bound characters in Dorohedoro

## Mages

I feel similarly about mages across the fantasy genre. I've always found myself gravitating towards martial characters without or with only limited magical abilities in games like Dungeons & Dragons unless there were significant advantages to playing mages or fun ways to pursue martial fighting styles as a mage.

Specifically, I felt that my implementation of the Elves in this setting and their massive influence on humanity would necessarily lead to a greater prevalence of martial characters as opposed to stereotypical wizards and sorcerers. When I think of ways of implementing battle mages, there are certainly a number of interesting directions that come to mind.

Enchanted artifacts, if made readily accessible to the warrior classes, are a good way to lend magical properties and abilities to otherwise martial units. The [[Materialist magics|materialist]] scholars and later the [[Necromancer demons]] they became are my stab at this idea. [[Psion|psions]], explored further below, could make extremely effective warrior mages as well. The furthest extreme, and a representation of near-unlimited and explosive power, would be the of the [[Oremongers Guild#artificer knights|artificer knights]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]].

### Inspiration

- Benders in Avatar: The Last Airbender
- Some magical Fighter and Barbarian subclasses in Dungeons & Dragons
- Muscle wizards from Dorohedoro
- Jedis as warrior mages in Star Wars
- The protagonist's pockets full of magical artifacts in Hellboy
- Gun witches in
- Heroic spirits n the Ufotable animations of the Fate franchise

## Psions

[[Psion|Psions]] are a super interesting yet oft-unexplored class of mage in fantasy, generally relegated to science fiction. Considering psychic or psionic powers are tied to our mental faculties that create our reality itself, I think it's safe to say that these have the potential to be unimaginably powerful. Plus, I think this ties in well to the setting's overarching focus on the nature of reality.

I find visual interpretations of such powers, which I generally refer to as the "psionic plane", particularly engaging. Not comprised of planes per say, this setting instead refers to this reality as the [[Psionic Sphere]], and it's a major part of being a psion in the [[Known World]]. Humanity's psions are freely and directly connected to the perceived realities of all those around them, flitting between the minds of others to steal or protect information.

### Inspiration

- Eleven and the other "numbers" in Stranger Things
- Spice-fueled psychic powers in the Dune universe
- That one psychic fungus issue of the Ellis's Moon Knight run
- Visual representations of Cerebro in the Fox X-Men movies
- Wanda (A.K.A. the Scarlet Witch) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
- Various characters and representations in the Hellboy universe

## Dragons

Dragons are obviously a major aspect of the fantasy genre, and one I've always found immensely engaging. The sheer amount of dragon-based toys, books, and trinkets I had in my childhood bedroom (and still have today) is actually a little embarrassing. Just like my general disinterest in genre mainstays like Elves and mages made me want to give them priority and reinvention, the fact that dragons are so key to me experience of fantasy made me want to take my own crack at it.

Enter the [[Dragon]], not a race of winged serpents or even a single, unique creature that can be found in the [[Known World]], but a cosmic entity representing the opposite all of unreality. It wasn't an easy decision, but it has certainly been an interesting one. It recontextualizes their selfishness, their tendency to hoard riches, and the idea of slaying the dragon. It also centers the Dragon in one of the three key sub-settings of Heavens Above; Gardens Below.

### Inspiration

- Certain representations of dragons in Dungeons & Dragons
- Certain legendary dragons in Magic the Gathering
