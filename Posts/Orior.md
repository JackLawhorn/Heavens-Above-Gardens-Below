The Orior – from the [[Organic magics of the Elven Legion#ELven tongue|Old Elven]] word meaning "to stand up" – are those peoples who have risen up to the light of [[Ylem]]. They are the children of the [[Angels]] and the inheritors of the [[Known World]].

The races of the Orior are nearly always risen up through contact with the [[Sun Elves]], so much so that the histories of these peoples are universally divided into [[pre-contact]] and post-contact periods. The exact mechanisms of this process are unknown, but it is thought that they involve the imparting of the [[Elven Tongue]] and other strange [[organic magics]].

## Anatomy of the Orior

The Orior are most commonly recognized by their shared anatomical features. These include segmentation of the body into a separate head and torso, and the differentiation between arms and legs which are used to stand upright. The majority of discovered races have been mammalian and very few have evolved from invertebrate creatures – all but the [[Verdant Knights]] who arose from the flora of the [[Known World]] and the [[Reef Knights]] who arose from the depths of the [[Sink]].

Another shared factor of their anatomy is the possession of [[organic magics]]. Only the humans arose without such abilities of their own.
