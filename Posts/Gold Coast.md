The Gold Coast is the western coast of the [[Old World continent]], extending northward from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], which has played a role in human history multiple times. First traveled along by the [[Sun Elves]] and [[human clans]] throughout the [[Elven March|Elven March period]]. Later, the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] would travel its length, tracing the steps of the Elven March on their [[Questing Charter of the Pretender|religious pilgrimage]] to the [[Deep Deserts]].

## Geography

Following the Gold Coast to the north, one reaches the [[Deep Deserts]]. To the south, it meets the [[Sun Coast]] of the [[Great Sea]] and its jewel: [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. The terrain along this length is much varied, from sandy beaches to rocky shores, and is largely uninterrupted save for the [[#Great Delta]].

To the east is the rest of the [[Old World continent]], including the [[Valley of Ruins]] and the many northern [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] of the [[Questing Houses]]. And to the west is the [[Sink]], into which the [[Sea Elves]] descended on their [[quest]]. The Gold Coast is rife with threats from the  the roving frenzies of the [[Akụm|Akụm marauders]] to the [[goblin clans]] to [[Gljiva, the Conquering Fungus]].

### Great Delta

Bisecting the Gold Coast is the Great Delta where humanity had its [[First parley with the elemental motes|first parley]] with the [[Mundial Aspects#elemental motes|elemental motes]]. Here, a branch of the same river [[Torrente]] which flows through [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] meets with the [[Sink]], leaving behind several large deposits of the sediment picked up along its path. Around the delta, an entire ecosystem has accumulated and passing through the area takes a day's trek or more.

## Journeys along the Gold Coast

The first of humanity's journeys along the Gold Coast was with the [[Sun Elves]] on their [[Elven March]], which led them to the gardens upon which [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] was [[Founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens|founded]]. The way was hard, covered in the [[nyxfire]] storms of the [[Wild Magics]], oft overgrown with vegetation, and home to the warring [[goblin clans]]. Thought to have numbered in the hundreds of thousands, a weak and vulnerable humanity slowed their [[Elven Legion|Elven]] protectors significantly.

The second was undertaken by the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] on their [[Questing Charter of the Pretender|religious pilgrimage]] to the [[Deep Deserts]]. This much smaller [[Questing Charter of the Pretender#The questing party|questing party]] found the way much easier. The path of the Elven March still stamped into the earth itself by hundreds of thousands of feet and what threats still remained there were easily dispatched by the [[Pretender]] and their trusted [[Mystic psionics#Psiknight|Psiknights]].
