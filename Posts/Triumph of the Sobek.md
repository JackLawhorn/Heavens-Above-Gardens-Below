It was dawn when the Triumph of the [[Sobek]] arrived in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], their ranks marching through the City's north gate. If not for the silence of the alarm bells and the escort of a pack of [[Silver Wolves]], they might have been received by the populace as an invading troop of enemy warriors. Still, their arrival was a surprise to all but a select and trusted few.

Humanity had heard tales of this race of the [[Orior]] – the riverfolk whose [[Pact magics|patron]] [[Aspect]] and [[Sobek(Minor Aspect)|namesake]] bled the rivers themselves – since the [[Elven March]], but had never seen them with their own eyes. And they were as the tales painted them: altogether alien and seemingly far more ancient than the humans themselves.

Their muscular bodies were covered in rough, scaly skin, dark green or black in color. A few who marched in positions of particular prominence were white as if covered in a layer of ash. Their broad, flattened snouts housed powerful jaws, and their jagged and teeth were visible even when their mouths were closed. Their eyes, high on the head and protruding slightly, lent them the appearance of alertness. Their short legs ended in webbed feet that betrayed their natural environment. Perhaps most distinctive of all were the powerful tails that dragged behind them, leaving trails in the dirt.

They wore simple cloth under ceremonial armor crafted from teeth and talons and bone. Some carried hooked spears like the harpoons of the [[Fisher Barons]], but many marched unarmed. And in truth they did not need them, for their countenance alone made many of the watchers on question if the [[Dragon]] himself was so formidable.

But this was not the only shocking sight that day, for amidst the Sobek and the Silver Wolves who escorted them was another party almost lost in their ranks: one dozen [[Sun Elves]] of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]]. No living Elf had been seen by human eyes since the [[Later Heliotropic Age]], but they were as beautiful as the legends told. Their once-gleaming bronze armor looked worn and dulled, and it was clear that they were coming to the end of a long journey.

Noticing them from the windows of the surrounding homes, any who had not yet done so flocked to the streets to receive this Triumph and followed them on their march through the [[rota]] with great intrigue. As they marched down the [[rayas|raya]], which led them towards the [[Elven Signaltower]], the crowd grew and grew until it seemed impossible that all of humanity was not marveling at the sight. It drew those displaced by the devastation of the [[Red Death period]] and the [[Burning]]. It drew humble workers of the [[Houses of Industry]] away from their work towards [[Reconstruction]]. And it drew [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]], who were just as stunned as their constituents.

As they passed the [[Scholars Quarter]], it drew students and teachers and artists and philosophers. Only the scholars of the [[Materialists College]] did not join the crowd. And if anyone had been looking at them they would have seen faces betraying visceral fear as they ran away in the direction of their [[College]].

Finally, the procession reached the heart of the City, stopping not at the base of the Signaltower but at the steps of the [[Court]]. There, the [[Orator|Orators]] of the [[House of the Sun]] and of the Silver Wolves stood waiting to receive the Triumph, who sent forth a number of the ashen Sobek and the Sun Elves to meet them. The Orators lead the representatives into the halls of the Court which stood empty with the Lord Representatives and their cabinet members waiting outside with the rest of the crowd.

There, in the halls of the Court, the Sobek gave their testimony, made their accusations as they had to the returned Sun Elves and to the Silver Wolves after them. They spoke with conviction and with an eloquence the Orators had not expected. They spoke with an assuredness and with a pain that spoke, thought the Orators, to the veracity of their claims. And all the while, the Sun Elves stood, listening, and seemed decidedly less stoic than was their nature.

After some time, the doors of the chamber opened and a troop of Silver Wolves entered. In their possession was the Orator of the Materialists College who they pushed to the ground as they would the lowliest of criminals. It was clear to see his face had been beaten, and the state of his garments indicated some resistance to the arrest.

"The laboratories have been seized, my Lord," the pack captain announced to their Orator. "Their furnaces had been burning hot. I fear evidence has been incinerated."

"You know not what you're doing," gasped the fallen Orator with ragged breath, "our work is paramount! Have you already forgotten our losses to the [[Red Court]]?"

For a split second, a crack appeared in the measured temperament of one of the Sun Elves. In one swift movement, they drew their spear and bashed the face of the accused with it, leaving him gushing blood from his nose.

"And the others?" asked the House of the Sun's Orator, ignoring the filth on the floor before them.

"We've rounded up what we could," the captain replied as if ashamed, "but I'm sorry to say a good number seem to have fled in haste. We have [[Rookish clans|rooks]] and a few trusted agents of the [[Jurisweard]] scouring the City."

"Please," begged the accused, "do you not see the need for our work? For the power we offer? Not since [[prehistory]] has humanity stood as vulnerable as we do now!"

"It is with vulnerability that you excuse your crimes?" growled one of the ashen Sobek. "It was out of vulnerability that your death squads – your *[[Necromancer demons|demons]]* – slaughtered and defiled our people?"

That word, *demon*, was spat with such vitriol that the accused, beaten and bleeding, found himself speechless.

The onlookers have been gathered for hours, steeped in their intrigue, when the Orators finally led the visitors to the City back out. The two Orators stood side by side, flanked by the ashen Sobek and backed by the Silver Wolves and the returned Sun Elves.

"We received word from the scouts of the [[Messengers Guild]] one week ago that the Sobek were marching on our City," they exclaimed. "I am sure you have all noticed that the Sun Elves walk with them, that they have returned to us. Under other circumstances this would be cause for celebration."

With this, the murmurings of the crowd disappear and all grow silent.

"I dispatched a pack of our Silver Wolves to meet them to the north," explained [[Clan Wolfstepper|Lord Wolfstepper]], "and I am... wounded... to have confirmed myself that--"

"The Materialists College has fallen!" exclaimed the other, impatient.

The crowd erupts once again into surprised murmuring, speculation spreading faster than the truth could be uttered. Could the end of the [[Red Death period]] not have been the end of their losses? This [[Ages of the Known World|age]], after all, had not yet been named the [[Crisis of Hubris]].

"The Sobek have informed us that the College has engaged in horrors beyond redemption, beyond humanity. That they have engaged in experiments of a most dark form of magics: [[Necromancy]]. That to continue those experiments... that they have marched on other races of the Orior and slaughtered entire villages!"

The nervous energy of the crowd cannot, at this point, be contained. Those few [[Materialist magics|materialists]] still hiding amongst the throng know now that their lives are in danger and begin moving away from the excitement.

"That their laboratories are stocked with specimens of flesh and blood and bone from the very peoples their death squads slaughtered!"

"The College has been abolished effective immediately," they explained, "and its scholars will be [[Fall of the Materialists College#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exiled]] from the City of Gardens. Should any of these *demons* be caught, they will face immediate execution!"

Looking down at the accused, kneeling before her feet, she whispered, "And as for you..." and kicked him down the gleaming white steps of the Court where he fell before the masses. "Do with him what you will!"

Looking up at the crazed faces above him, he just barely manages to utter, "The [[Umbral Aspects]] are descending on the [[Known World]]... Please believe me... Kill me if you must but ready yourselves. The [[Nyx]] is fa--"

And with that, he disappeared into the throngs of the crowd. It is said they remained there for hours, and what was left of him was found scattered across the square only when the crowd dissipated.

Such was the fall of the Materialists College, and the necromancer demons they had become in their corruption. Though exiled by their people from the City of Gardens, their remnants survive to this day across the [[Great Sea]] on their accursed [[Isle of Melos]].

> The [[Materialists College]] had been much celebrated and granted [[Great House|Great Houseship]] for their contribution to human knowledge and the promise of extending the potential of the race born without [[organic magics]] of its own. Its [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]] warns us of the threat of corruption, for no treasure or power may balance against the horrors born of such sin.
