An [[extramundane]] biome formed during and because of the raging [[nyxfire]] storms of the [[Wild Magics]] and the [[roiling of the elements]] that occurred after the [[fallen world|fall]] of the [[Old World]]. These Wilds blanket the east of the [[Old World continent]] and it is said that the magics, though tamed, are so concentrated there that they warp the [[Laws of Power]] themselves.

As such, attempts by humanity to penetrate their perimeter have only led to the loss of all contact with the exploring parties. This most notably includes the [[Agisters Guild]] who [[Fall of the Agisters Guild|fell]] to their warping influence.

## Inhabitants of the Astral Wilds

The Astral Wilds are home to strange creatures thought to be so close to the [[Ylem]] and to the magics that they are able to withstand the devastating ravaging of this environment. They oftentimes do not resemble any known peoples or beasts that exist elsewhere in the [[Known World]], and may possess organic magics that are entirely unique.

### Verdant Knights

> For more, see [[Verdant Knights]].

The orders of the [[Verdant Knights]] were the first of the inhabitants of the Wilds to come from beyond their veil. One of the only race of the [[Orior]] to have evolved from flora rather than fauna, the Verdant Knights appear particularly alien. Within the Astral Wilds, they are a ruling class of chivalric warriors and it is said that they are so close to [[Ylem]] that they feed upon its very light for sustenance.

### Chimera

> For more, see [[Chimera]].

The chimera are beasts hailing from beyond the veil of the Astral Wilds, where blurring of the physical reality of the [[Prime Material Sphere]] by unnatural bending of the [[Laws of Power]] have created accursed creatures born of two sometimes greatly differing species of beast. Their forms are comprised of entirely different anatomies, not by the mating of these creatures but by being physically blended together.

Those who survive this blending are unable to mate with other beasts and therefor the chimera population within the Astral Wilds is generally stable. They are often in a state of visible distress and aggravation, and can be a dangerous threat to [[quest|questing parties]].
