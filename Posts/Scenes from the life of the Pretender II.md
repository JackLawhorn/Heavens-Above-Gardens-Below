The rapid clanging of [[silver]] against silver rang through the air as the scholar walked through the den of the hallowed [[Silver Wolves]]. Here, humanity's greatest and longest-standing order of warriors lived and trained and continued on the traditions of their [[Clan Wolfstepper|Clan]].

He was there to see the weirdling child, his ward these last years. They had been living in secret here under watchful protection, a necessary bargain after the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]] of his own [[Materialists College]] and the persecution that followed. The scholar no longer donned his mage's cloak nor his [[Materialist magics|materialist]] trinkets nor the [[labrum]] of his [[Fallen Houses|Fallen House]]. Not in public where they might be noticed.

As he came upon the courtyard which was deepest into the den and most private to the outside world, he felt the familiar presence of his child before he saw them. This had become routine to him, but was a revelation in the studies of the magics. A new field entirely, one of the mind and as of yet unique to one human child: the field of [[psionics]]. He had come up with the name and in truth he was the last materialist scholar left in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] to be able to do so.

Rounding the corner, he saw the child facing a wolf thrice their size, the two circling each other just within the bounds of a combat ring. The child held a small dagger. The wolf was bare, not donning any of their silver this day. The scholar found a bench and sat. Perhaps today would be the day the child would find victory.

But no, they were not so lucky. In a flash, the wolf lunged forward and had pinned the child to the ground, the dagger out of their hand and just out of reach. Just as fast, the wolf was no longer there and in its place was a captain of the Silver Wolves. She was muscular, with the dark features of a child of Clan Wolfstepper.

"I know you see my next action before I take it," she said still applying pressure. "You must only learn to understand it and react. What was your mistake this time?"

"Papa's here. He distracted me," the child spat responded, clearly frustrated at the result. "His perspective. He does not see what I see and so I lost sight of your next move."

The captain looked over at the child's guardian with a scowl before standing. "So he is. Very well. But do not expect that excuse to work next time."

Before she had finished speaking, the child had jumped up and was running to the scholar, the warning no doubt falling on deaf ears. He stood to meet his ward and was greeted with a warm embrace. This must be what it's like to have a child of one's own. It was not the first time he had had such a thought but still he scolded himself for it, knowing no such thoughts were private from the child.

"I try not to listen, papa," they said, barely containing a knowing smile.

This day was like any other.

The scholar was informed by the child's teachers of their progress, not quite up to their expectations as it never was. He was used to their disapproval. Their disapproval of his ward's temperament. Their disapproval of his former [[College]], now fallen just as the [[Oremongers Guild]] and [[House Lightbringer]] had. He was used to the looks from Silver Wolves as he passed through their corridors, the spiteful and barely-concealed mutterings of *[[Necromancer demons|demon]]* behind his back. The rest of the City was blind to his past but it was as if they could smell the sin on him.

The hard part out of the way, the odd pair found a place to eat a ways away from prying eyes and ears. He told the child about his day, about the wonders of the City outside these walls. He told them about the newest works of [[Reconstruction]] as he always did, and they sat in silence for a few moments after as they always had. They were bonded by the devastation of the [[Red Death period]] and of the great and terrible [[Burning]] that brought it to its end. All of humanity had been bonded by loss, but so too they the two of them been bonded by finding each other.

"Tell me," he began again after the moment had passed, "how does it feel? To see what you see, I mean."

"It hurts sometimes," they responded solemnly, still facing away. "I can see what you see. I can hear what my teachers hear in the far courtyard. Everyone sees things differently, even the same things look different to you. It isn't easy to know what's real sometimes."

"I suppose that must be hard," the scholar replied with a sadness.

"But it can be beautiful too," the child said before pausing for a moment. The scholar recognized this, knew they were searching for anyone who might be listening. "I saw something yesterday, after you left. It wasn't a mind. It felt like a place. And the place led me further into it until I saw... something."

"What kind of something?" he asked, curious.

"I don't know," they mumbled as if shying away from the subject. "It felt like the future."

Back inside, the scholar watched his ward through stained glass while he was berated by the [[Orator]] of the Silver Wolves. The child was playing a spontaneous game of [[Sports and contest#calcio|calcio]] with the young boys and girls of Clan Wolfstepper. It was not rare that he found himself in such a conversation, and he found himself tracing the paths formed in the grout between the now-familiar shards of glass.

Suddenly, he noticed that the conversation had at some point fallen silent and turned his attention back to the Orator.

"I'm sorry," he mumbled, making a less than convincing effort of feigning apology, "can you repeat that?"

"We've run out of time," sighed the Orator. "Six years. That's how long I said we would have. Six years ago you came to my doorstep and bargained for protection from the consequences of your sins."

"For the College's sins, please," the scholar spat back, his attention slowly turning back to the window. "If you have found evidence of my involvement or knowledge I invite you to strike me down where I stand. Better perish now than suffer another one of your--"

"You are not listening to me," he said, exasperated. "Our time is up. The child is grown, soon they'll be an adult and clearly not of Clan Wolfstepper."

*Could it have been six years already?* thought the scholar. "What exactly are you saying?"

"I'm saying that we've done all we can do," he said, his voice betraying an ounce of pity. "The [[House of the Sun]] will want them now and there's nothing I can do to dissuade them."

*No. This can't be.*

The Orator continued, no doubt explaining the logistics of this development, but his voice faded away along with the rest of the room. Looking through the window once more, the scholar scanned the field his ward. He found them staring back, tears in their eyes as the others continued their contest.

*Things are going to be different now.*
