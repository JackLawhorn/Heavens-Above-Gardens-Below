The Later Crisis of Hubris is defined as stretching from the night of the great [[Burning]] – which ended the [[Red Death period]] – to the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] of the [[Silver Wolves]] which heralded in the [[Renascence period]]. 

## Reconstruction

In the aftermath of the [[Red Death period]] and the [[Burning]] that ended it, a great [[Reconstruction]] effort was begun to rebuild both [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its people. Although Reconstruction would extend far past the end of the [[Crisis of Hubris]] and into the [[Renascence period]], the Later Crisis of Hubris is remembered in part for many of its [[Great Works]]. The face of the City would be forever changed not only by the rebuilding of the [[Red Quarter]] and the [[Barony of Stilts]] but also the creation of [[Reconstruction#New defenses in the City|new defenses]] from similar threats in the future.

## Rise of the House of the Sun

The [[House of the Sun]], whose [[House of the Sun#Daywatch|Daywatch]] oversaw the great and terrible [[Burning]] to end the [[Red Death period]], rapidly grew to prominence throughout the Later Crisis of Hubris. Since its founding in the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]], they had previously been a relatively inconsequential player in the politics of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. After the Red Death period, however, they were a central player in matters of the Court and in human history in general. They became humanity's [[House of the Sun#lorekeepers|lorekeepers]], leaders of worship and facilitators of the City's [[State religion]], and ultimately the last remaining [[Great House]] of the [[Court]].

## Dawn of the Psionic Age

The Later Crisis of Hubris saw the [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of what is now called the [[Psionic Age]]. This period, stretching from the [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revelation]] of the [[Pretender]] through the [[Early Renascence period]], saw the rise and fall of [[Mystic psionics]] and the meteoric rise of the [[Psionics College]] which rose from the ashes.

## Continued fall of the Great Houses

The [[Red Death period]] and the threat of the [[Red Court]] may have been ended but the losses of the [[Crisis of Hubris]] was far from over, including the [[Fallen Houses|fall]] of three more [[Great House|Great Houses]]: the [[Materialists College]], the [[Disciples of the Pretender]], and the [[Silver Wolves]]. Now under the stewardship of the increasingly prominent [[House of the Sun]], humanity defined moral lessons from each of these losses. The moral and ethical learnings of the Later Crisis of Hubris would come to define humanity and its history for [[Ages of the Known World|ages]] to come.

## Death of cland culture

With the losses of the [[Red Death period]], the influence of the [[human clans]] were largely lost. The survivors who gathered in the [[Barony of Stilts]] formed cultures of their own apart from any [[cland]] identity. As of the Later Crisis of Hubris, all but a few clans – namely [[Clan Wolfstepper]] and some of the [[Rookish clans]] – have constellated and now one would instead trace their life and lineage based on patron [[House|Houses]].

Houses of the [[Court]] became the backbone of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and integral to life there. One's place of birth, home, education, industry, and other opportunities are largely dictated by the House they are born into or move to.
