## First Wave Henotheism

[[Henotheist]] art was performed and produced as acts of worship – monuments within monuments to [[Ylem]] in the loose shape of a city – and was an explosive collective chorus of artistic expression after an untold number of generations of humanity born and dead on the [[Elven March|March]].

First Wave Henotheism introduced the artforms of architecture, landscaping, and botany. Upon the [[founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] at the precipice of the [[Later Heliotropic Age]], the [[Mundial Aspects|elements]] themselves were channeled – both by the [[Sun Elves]] and by the first ranks of the [[Oremongers Guild]] – to shape the many streets and structures and monuments of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]]. The dazzlingly beautiful, impossibly perfect [[Old City]] was shaped around the gardens, leaving pockets like parks, fields, hills, and even alleys, squares, and rooftops verdant green and impeccably maintained.

## Late Heliotropic Objectivism

In the [[Later Heliotropic Age]], human art would develop forward from purely [[Henotheist|Henotheistic]] sensibilities and motivations. The [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivists]], without the earth-rending power of the [[Oremongers Guild#Earth shapers|Guild earth shapers]] or the [[Sun Elves]], produced realistic art portraying the [[Known World]] around them. Late Heliotropic Objectivism introduced the artform of sculpture and is considered to have ushered in modern painting through the development of portraiture, landscapes, and cityscapes. This focus on reproducing the wonders of [[Ylem]] aligned closely with the rise of the [[Humanism|humanist movement]].

The humans sought to reproduce everything under the [[Nyx]] by their own hands, and the lost works of this period are said to have included thousands of paintings portraying every street, garden, bridge, and alley in remarkable detail. Seeking what they called the "Truth of Form", Objectivists would produce more and more geometric and exacting sculptures. Though the populace would generally reject them at the time, the later of these pieces – namely the series called the [[Cult of Pythos#Divine Geometries|Divine Geometries]] – maintain significant influence in art, philosophy, and mathematics today.

These are considered to be among the greatest losses of the [[Red Death period]] and the great [[Burning]] that brought it to an end. The Objectivists were among the loudest proponents of punishing the young [[House of the Sun]] for the devastation. Ironically, the Red Death period also ushered forward significant advancements in Objectivist art. As the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s great many cadavers – both human corpses and those infected by the [[Red Court]] – were dissected and studied by the scholars of the [[Materialists College]]. This led to a revolution in human understanding of the anatomy and a greater understanding of form and of the [[albedo]] that also benefitted Objectivist art portraying human subjects.

## Second Wave Henotheism

Despite the [[Red Death period]]'s eventual impact on [[#Late Heliotropic Objectivism|Objectivist art]], art from this period is best well known for what [[#Subjectivism|Subjectivist]] scholars would call Second Wave Henotheism. This movement's art depicted the [[Ylem]] allegorically rather than through the [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivist]] lens. Those few paintings that survived the [[Burning]] – and especially those that came after – depicted a [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]] beset upon by the great celestial [[Dragon]] and his forces of evil; humanity's [[iconic pacts|patron]] Ylem laying slain or, worse, simply absent.

Among the iconic imagery of this period is of course the victims, heroes, and villains of the [[Red Death]]: the sick and dying, the wounded, and the burning; the near-life, beast-like soldiers of the [[Red Court]]; the thorny, inky black vines of the [[Nyxblight]]; the forces of the [[Apotropaics]] beating back the darkness with their torches; the [[House of the Sun]], the [[Elven Signaltower]], and the great Burning.

Other common themes within the art and in particular the paintings of the Second Wave Henotheists were blood and death, darkness and shadow, fear and bravery, fire and hope. The [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] is famous for its near-universal motif of deep red tones, which most infamously extended into the reconstruction of the razed portion of the [[Old City]], which would come to be known as the [[Red Quarter]].

After the great Burning, [[Henotheist]] pieces depicted humanity's patron Ylem returning and even aiding in the massive projects of [[Reconstruction]]. With the benefit of greater context, later Henotheists would also incorporate imagery of the lost [[House Lightbringer]], the [[Red King]], and his dark master.

## Psionic art

Pioneered by the [[Pretender]]'s [[Mystic psionics#Illusionist|illusionists]] at the [[Psionic Age#dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of the [[Psionic Age]], [[Psionics|psionic]] art is a medium that relies on [[Psionics#Hallucination|Hallucination]] to manifest false sensory data in the [[Psionic Sphere]]. Psionic art exists in more dimensions than more than the visual or performance arts, and can include sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and pleasures that no other medium can illicit. Partially due to this boundless possibility, psionic artists leaned further into the surreal and the abstract than any [[Scholars of the City#Subjectivists|subjectivists]] before or since.

After the [[Fall of the Pretender]], the [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist]] [[Psion|psions]] of the [[Psionics College]] largely abandoned such pursuits. One notable exception is the short-lived genre of [[Psychedelia#Psychedelic art|psychedelic art]] in the [[Early Renascence period]], though this was brought to an early end with the criminalization of [[psychedelia]] by the [[House of Vice]] immediately following the [[Exile of the Dreaming psions|exile]] of the [[Dreaming psions]].

## Subjectivism

Humanity would then veer to Subjectivism: a movement born out of [[#Second Wave Henotheism]] and embracing the allegorical and the surreal rather than [[the Objective]]. Many of the Subjectivists would go on to form or join the [[First Vergonic Church]], a philosophical thought experiment that pushed Subjectivist art into the modern era. Vergonic art centered around the origin and nature of Truth, which sat opposite the opposing force of Untruth.

The Subjectivists would develop the first actively political works, seeking to communicate and persuade political ideals. The First Vergonic Church's philosophies on life, politics, the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]], and her [[Social Spheres Theory|Spheres]] would go on to have profound impact on any number of matters of the [[Court]], especially as many of its members held voting power as [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] or their cabinet members. [[House|Houses]] of the Court saw their power wax and wane by the hand of the Church. The [[Disciples of the Pretender]], [[House of the Sun]], the [[College|colleges]] and their [[Scholars of the City|scholars]], and the [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] were just some with which the Church had a contentious relationship.

Subjectivism would also introduce increasingly abstract artworks. Humanity's portraits, landscapes, and cityscapes grew more and more surreal and stylized. Later Vergonic work would intersect with [[#Psychedelia]] before the eventual [[Vergonic War|dissolution of the Church]].

## Renascence Objectivism

After the loss of human history in the [[Crisis of Hubris]], the art of the [[Renascence]] primarily centered around capturing historical events and the reality of the present. There was a great [[Humanism|humanist]] lean in what is now beginning to be dubbed "Renascence [[the Objective|Objectivism]]", which dealt primarily with mortals and the mundane rather than the [[Ylem]] and divinity.

This purpose also necessitated a dramatic turn towards realism in visual art. This period saw the invention of proportion – based on the work of [[Cult of Pythos#Pythos|Pythos]] – as well as the use of artistic techniques such as foreshortening and sfumato and chiaroscuro. It also saw the practical application of the studies of the [[History of materialist magics#The Red Death period|anatomists]] of the [[Materialists College]] in depicting the physicality of not only humans but the [[Sobek]] and other races of the [[Orior]].
