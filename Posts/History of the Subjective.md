## First Wave Henotheism

[[Henotheist]] art was performed and produced as acts of worship – monuments within monuments to [[Ylem]] in the loose shape of a city – and was an explosive collective chorus of artistic expression after an untold number of generations of humanity born and dead on the [[Elven March|March]].

First Wave Henotheism introduced the artforms of architecture, landscaping, and botany. Upon the [[founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] at the precipice of the [[Later Heliotropic Age]], the [[Mundial Aspects|elements]] themselves were channeled – both by the [[Sun Elves]] and by the first ranks of the [[Oremongers Guild]] – to shape the many streets and structures and monuments of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]]. The dazzlingly beautiful, impossibly perfect [[Old City]] was shaped around the gardens, leaving pockets like parks, fields, hills, and even alleys, squares, and rooftops verdant green and impeccably maintained.

## Late Heliotropic Objectivism

In the [[Later Heliotropic Age]], human art would develop forward from purely [[Henotheist|Henotheistic]] sensibilities and motivations. The [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivists]], without the earth-rending power of the [[Oremongers Guild#Earth shapers|Guild earth shapers]] or the [[Sun Elves]], produced realistic art portraying the [[Known World]] around them. Late Heliotropic Objectivism introduced the artform of sculpture and is considered to have ushered in modern painting through the development of portraiture, landscapes, and cityscapes.

The humans sought to reproduce everything under the [[Nyx]] by their own hands, and the lost works of this period are said to have included thousands of paintings portraying every street, garden, bridge, and alley in remarkable detail. Seeking what they called the "Truth of Form", Objectivists would produce more and more geometric and exacting sculptures. Though the populace would generally reject them at the time, the later of these pieces – namely the series called the [[Cult of Pythos#Divine Geometries|Divine Geometries]] – maintain significant influence in art, philosophy, and mathematics today.

These are considered to be among the greatest losses of the [[Red Death period]] and the great [[Burning]] that brought it to an end. The Objectivists were among the loudest proponents of punishing the young [[House of the Sun]] for the devastation. Ironically, the Red Death period also ushered forward significant advancements in Objectivist art. As the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s great many cadavers – both human corpses and those infected by the [[Red Court]] – were dissected and studied by the scholars of the [[Materialists College]]. This led to a revolution in human understanding of the anatomy and a greater understanding of form and of the [[albedo]] that also benefitted Objectivist art portraying human subjects.

## Second Wave Henotheism

Despite the [[Red Death period]]'s eventual impact on [[#Late Heliotropic Objectivism|Objectivist art]], art from this period is best well known for what [[#Subjectivism|Subjectivist]] scholars would call Second Wave Henotheism. This movement's art depicted the [[Ylem]] allegorically rather than through the [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|Objectivist]] lens. Those few paintings that survived the [[Burning]] – and especially those that came after – depicted a [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]] beset upon by the great celestial [[Dragon]] and his forces of evil; humanity's [[Pact magics|patron]] Ylem laying slain or, worse, simply absent.

Among the iconic imagery of this period is of course the victims, heroes, and villains of the [[Red Death]]: the sick and dying, the wounded, and the burning; the near-life, beast-like soldiers of the [[Red Court]]; the thorny, inky black vines of the [[nyxblight]]; the forces of the [[apotropaics]] beating back the darkness with their torches; the [[House of the Sun]], the [[Elven Signaltower]], and the great Burning.

Other common themes within the art and in particular the paintings of the Second Wave Henotheists were blood and death, darkness and shadow, fear and bravery, fire and hope. The [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] is famous for its near-universal motif of deep red tones, which most infamously extended into the reconstruction of the razed portion of the [[Old City]], which would come to be known as the [[Red Quarter]].

After the great Burning, [[Henotheist]] pieces depicted humanity's patron Ylem returning and even aiding in the massive projects of [[Reconstruction]]. With the benefit of greater context, later Henotheists would also incorporate imagery of the lost [[House Lightbringer]], the [[Red King]], and his dark master.

## Subjectivism

Humanity would then veer to Subjectivism: a movement born out of [[#Second Wave Henotheism]] and embracing the allegorical and the surreal rather than [[the Objective]]. Many of the Subjectivists would go on to form or join the [[First Vergonic Church]], a philosophical thought experiment that pushed Subjectivist art into the modern era. Vergonic art centered around the origin and nature of Truth, which sat opposite the opposing force of Untruth.

The Subjectivists would develop the first actively political works, seeking to communicate and persuade political ideals. The First Vergonic Church's philosophies on life, politics, the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]], and her [[Social Spheres Theory|Spheres]] would go on to have profound impact on any number of matters of the [[Court]], especially as many of its members held voting power as [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] or their cabinet members. [[House|Houses]] of the Court saw their power wax and wane by the hand of the Church. The [[Disciples of the Pretender]], [[House of the Sun]], the [[College|colleges]] and their [[Scholars of the City|scholars]], and the [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] were just some with which the Church had a contentious relationship.

Subjectivism would also introduce increasingly abstract artworks. Humanity's portraits, landscapes, and cityscapes grew more and more surreal and stylized. Later Vergonic work would intersect with [[#Psychedelia]] before the eventual [[Vergonic War|dissolution of the Church]].

## Psychedelia

Psychedelia are drugs that affect the mind and its perception of reality. The rise of psychedelia is inextricably tied to the rise of the [[Disciples of the Pretender]], although it is not known which caused the other. The Disciples transformed entire streets and squares into gardens where both produce and psychedelic flowers and fungi could be freely picked and consumed.

Those under the influence of psychedelia come dangerously close to bending the [[Laws of Power]], which govern Space and Time. In addition to this great and dangerous [[paradoxy]], psychedelia is known to temporarily enhance and even awaken [[psionics|psionic]] potential in those who consume them. The [[Renascence]] scholars of the [[Psionics College]] would push these boundaries almost to their breaking point until finally a string of devastating psionic attacks would be unconsciously unleashed on [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] in the [[Late Renascence Era]]. All psychedelic substances are now restricted by the [[House of Vice]] as [[Drugs in the City#Highly-Controlled Substances (HCSs)|Highly-Controlled Substances (HCSs)]].

Psychedelic artists leaned further into the surreal and the abstract than even the [[#Subjectivism|Subjectivists]] of the [[First Vergonic Church]] had. Due to its ties to psionics, many of the few pieces created during the drugs' legality are psionically and emotionally imprinted upon by their creators. Psychedelic Renascence art is among the most valuable on the market today, as their limited number of works and impossibly immense emotional depth make them sought after around the [[Known World]].
