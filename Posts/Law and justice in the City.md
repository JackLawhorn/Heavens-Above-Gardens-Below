## Classifications of crime

The [[Scholars of the City#Subjectivists|Subjectivists]] of the [[Scholars Quarter]] have defined three classifications of crime: simple, complex, and organized.

> For more on the agents of law and justice themselves, see [[Jurisweard]].

### Simple crime

Simple crime is that committed by a single perpetrator and for base reasons. The criminality itself of these acts self-evident, simple crimes are dealt with by the [[Jurisweard]] mostly by enforcing the punishment of the perpetrator and – when possible – reparations to the victims.

### Complex crime

Complex crime is committed by multiple perpetrators or by one whose motives are more complex. The criminality of these acts must be investigated, and the findings of that investigation brought before the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]] and their [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]]. As the records of these complex crimes populate the [[Public Record]] and its [[Hall of Precedent]], they become easier to investigate and prosecute going forward.

### Organized crime

The term "organized crime" found purchase during the [[Early Renascence period]] after powerful criminal factions had risen from the ashes of [[Reconstruction]]. It is defined as having been committed by a group displaying shared objectives and some form of organizational hierarchy. Most criminal factions possess some form of [[Court]] influence – either public recognition by or an illicit connection to a [[House]] of influence.

## Crimes in the City

Though uncommon, violation of terms of exile is one of the more major crimes that necessitates the agents of the [[Jurisweard]]. Not only are the exiled factions criminals, but most are also immensely powerful and capable of incalculable damage to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its populace. [[Necromancer demons]], the exiled [[Silver Wolves]] of the [[New Silver Age]], and especially the [[dreaming psions]] are eliminated with quickly and with prejudice when identified in the City. Violation of terms of exile is punished as a [[#simple crime]].

Also major aspects of the Jurisweard's domain are the [[#complex crime|complex crimes]] of interpersonal violence and theft, damage, and destruction of property. Of the latter, most heavily prioritized are theft or damage to the [[Great Works]], scholarly or historical materials protected under [[Public Scholarship]] law, and damage to the [[City infrastructure and layout#gardens|gardens of the City]].

Theft of regulated [[materialist magics#Materialist artifacts|materialist artifacts]] is also prioritized as they can grant immense power without oversight by a [[Pact magics|patron]] [[Aspect]]. Similarly, consumption, possession, and distribution of restricted, psychedelic substances are a particularly potent threat as they can awaken powerful, dormant [[psioncs|psionic]] abilities while also hampering ones ability to reign them in. The exile of the dreaming psions was made necessary for this very reason.

## Unlawful districts and neighborhoods

It is no secret among the peoples of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] that the criminal element has proliferated throughout the poorer, lower-class district known as the [[Cumbergrounds]]. The [[Jurisweard]] is afforded only limited jurisdiction by the inhabitants of these neighborhoods, who rely on each other to enforce law and order there. Because of this, a number of criminal factions find refuge within the Cumbergrounds.
