The Disciples of the Pretender were humanity's first [[Psionics|psionic]] faction, rising up in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] around the first known human [[psion]]: the [[Pretender]]. The Disciples are the largest and most influential [[cults|cult]] in the history of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], numbering in the thousands and far greater than any [[Iconic House|heterodoxy]] of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies|Canon]]. Their rise and that of their messiah marked the [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of what is now called the [[Psionic Age]].

## History of the Disciples of the Pretender

### Revelation of the Pretender

Within hours of [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revealing]] themself to the humanity in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the [[Pretender]] had amassed dozens of Disciples. A people without [[organic magics]] of their own, humanity was eager to believe in the opportunity for exultation and [[psionics]] appeared almost as a miracle to these early Disciples. The revelation of the Pretender and of the field of psionics brought about the [[Psionic Age#Dawn of the Psionic Age|dawn]] of what is now called the [[Psionic Age]].

It would eventually be revealed that the Pretender and their [[psionics#psionic abilities|psionic abilities]] had been known by the [[Great House|Great Houses]] – the [[House of the Sun]] and the [[Silver Wolves]] – for some time, but the revelation to the wider populace ensured there was little they could do to curb the progress to come.

### Disciples of the Pretender in the City

Under the stewardship of the [[Pretender]] and their Disciples, [[mystic psionics]] grew into a sizable [[cults|cult]] quickly spreading both [[Psionics#Psionic influence|psionic influence]] and [[belief in the Pretender]] throughout the human population. These early [[Psion|psions]] formed classes like the [[Mystic psionics#Psiknights|Psiknights]], [[Mystic psionics#dwaalstepper|dwaalsteppers]], and [[Mystic psionics#Illusionist|illusionists]], and soon the entire City was populated by their camps and tents and transformed by their [[Psionics#Hallucination|illusions]]. Their works – spectacles though they may have been – helped to heal the wounds of a humanity still recovering from the losses of the [[Red Death period]] and the [[Fall of the Materialists College|fall]] of the [[Materialists College]].

### Questing Charter and fall of the Pretender

Some years after their [[Scenes from the life of the Pretender III|revelation]] to humanity, the [[Pretender]] announced to their Disciples plans to argue for a [[Questing Charter]]. There existed a beacon, they said, on the northern horizon: a place where the membrane between the [[Psionic Sphere]] and the [[Prime Material Sphere]] was thin. Standing before the [[Orator|Orators]] of the [[Great House|Great Houses]] and the [[Lord Representative|Lord Representatives]] of all the [[House|Houses]] of the [[Court]], the Pretender outlined a march north along the [[Gold Coast]] and into the [[Deep Deserts]] where no human had ever ventured. There, they said, laid the future of not only the human [[Psion|psions]] but of all of humanity.

[[Questing Charter of the Pretender|Their Questing Charter]] was ultimately granted with majority support in Court. Though the Great Houses and their Orators were among the detractors – which most notably also included the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] – they formulated a plan to deal with their rising power. The Disciples of the Pretender had their Questing Charter granted and were also named as the sixth Great House of the Court, ensuring access to the resources needed for such a [[quest]].

Ultimately, this religious pilgrimage proved a [[Quest into Oblivion]], and led to the [[Fall of the Pretender]]. Only a handful of the Disciples survived to return to [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] with the news, and the fall of yet another Great House was moralized just as much as the others.
