The sea walls and the beaches where [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] extends to the [[Sun Coast]] are embroiled in bloody conflict with raiding pirates: a frenzy of [[Akụm]] emerged from the depths of the [[Sink]]. The waters, lit only by moonlight and the far off torches, are frothed and red-black. The spilled blood overpowers the nose, and the clanging weaponry and of the warning bells can be heard deep into the City.

The [[Fisher Barons]], caught off-guard by the marauders, have suffered significant losses but have managed to stave off the invasion until the warrior classes of the City were able to join the fight. This is not the first such raid. Both along the [[Elven March]] down the [[Gold Coast]] to the north and here in the City of Gardens, the Akụm have been a near constant threat to a vulnerable humanity. And so the sea peoples among their number have grown proficient in the use of their nets and harpoons to fend of attacks when necessary.

The arrival of a pack of [[Silver Wolves]] and a squad of [[House Lightbringer]]'s torchbearer paladins begin to turn the tide, but the City's most powerful weapon – the [[Oremongers Guild#artificer knights|artificer knights]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] – are still not present to bring the fight to its end. Later, it would come to light that their newly founded base of operations in the mines northeast of the City was too far for them to hear the warning bells. Even if they had, transporting their steel to this particular battlefield would likely have presented a significant challenge.

Against the human blades and spears and the ranged weapons of the [[Rookish clans|rooks]], the Akụm levies bites that ripped and tore into their enemies and pronged spears until the battlefield and everyone present was drenched in blood. As the marauders – strong but sickly looking – fell one by one, a seemingly endless frenzy continued to emerge from the Sink. And even speared by a harpoon and pinned down to the ground, they spent their last gasps cursing their enemy in the name of some dark [[Pact magics|patron]] of the depths.

_Do what you will to me, sleeping one! You cur, you mongrel! You turned your back on the greatest of your gods and now us wakeful will come to retake the surface world for the depths! Go to your cowardly patrons tell them that the [[Nyx]] will be flooded first by the waters of this world and then with their blood!_

Eventually, the tide begins to turn in the attackers' favor, seemingly brought to an even more frenzied state the longer the battle went on. There was something in their eyes, black and hateful and fanatical to a one. And their jagged maws frenetically reached for every opportunity to tear a chunk out of the human defenders. But just as the humans began to fall back into a defensive barrier in an attempt to prevent the frenzy from spilling out into the City of Gardens, a third party emerged from the Sink.

The Akụm turn back as if in disbelief, in a split second their frenzied rage turning first to astonishment and then to scared, disappointed realization. In truth, the humans were even more astonished, for what they saw resembled neither any beast they'd seen nor what they understood as the form of the [[Orior]]: it was an army of gargantuan, alien-looking allies clad in heavy armor and wielding a storm of snipping, piercing appendages.

Surely enough, however, they were allies to the humans. Within minutes, these creatures ended the conflict, savaging dozens of the Akụm marauders and sending the rest of their ranks fleeing with that fearful look in their black eyes. When all that was left on the coast were the blood and the bodies, the humans and their newfound allies, the latter slowly retreated back into the shallows leaving just one of their number behind.

Over the next weeks, a bond between these peoples was formed. Not having come into contact with the Elves, the creatures who called themselves the [[Oklop]] could not speak or understand the [[Elven tongue|tongue]] but were found to be intelligent beings and a race of the Orior in their own right. In place of a voice they possessed organs which emanated deep, mind-shaking vibrations which over time they were able to translate to simple words and phrases that a human might understand.

They came from coastlines of the [[lands to the south]], following the light of the [[Elven Signaltower]], and their ranks now formed a new consortium here along the Sun Coast. Keeping to this coastline, their relationship with humanity was primarily maintained through the Fisher Barons and other waterfolk. Not wanting too much for the goods and services valued by the humans, they instead displayed an interest in a wide variety of often useless trinkets and bobbles which they held in vast [[Oklop#Oklop hordes|hordes]].

In return, the consortium serves as a protective, coastal barrier that deters attacks by other sea beasts and peoples like the Akụm, who never raided Omphalos, the City of Gardens again.
