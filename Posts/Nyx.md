> [!INFO] What is the Nyx?
> The Nyx is at once the universe described by the [[Prime Material Sphere]], all of reality across all Spheres described by [[Standard Elven Cosmology]], and the cosmic duality of [[Ylem]] and the [[Dragon]] themselves. For a better understanding of each of these interpretations, follow the suggested materials below.

## The duality of the Nyx

In one sense, the Nyx is defined by [[Ylem]] – reality, creation, and all that is – and its eternal conflict with the [[Dragon]] – unreality and all that is not, has never been, and can not be. If this conflict has a name it has not been spoken, but it is referred to as the [[roiling of the Nyx]] by the [[Sun Elves]] of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]]. This duality is the reality of the [[Astral Sphere]], a purely digital existence and the primary battleground of this roiling.

## The Nyx and the Spheres

In one sense, the Nyx is reality itself which – as described in [[Standard Elven Cosmology]] – is comprised of great heavenly Spheres which spin and grind against each other, overlapping and intersecting to create each and every pocket of existence. Realities such as our [[Prime Material Sphere]] sprung from the [[Astral Sphere]] of the [[Ylem]], creating new battlegrounds upon which the [[roiling of the Nyx]] would be fought.

Such realms would be populated by both sides of the conflict with soldiers and weapons such as the [[Angels]] and the [[Elven Legion|Elven Legions]], the [[Vestiges]] and the [[Umbral Aspects]]. All of humanity and indeed all life across the Nyx has a part to play in this roiling.

## Astral bodies of the Nyx

In one sense, the Nyx is a universe described by the [[Prime Material Sphere]]. Within this understanding, the [[Known World]] and all it encapsulates is simply one of an untold number of worlds in an untold number of galaxies. There are some, like the [[Elven Legion|Elven Legions]] who live as [[nyxfarer|nyxfarer]] traversing from world to world and across this universe on their divine [[quest]] from the [[Angels]].
