"Reconstruction" refers to the massive efforts to rebuild [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and the human population after the losses of the [[Red Death period]]. The Reconstruction period extended from the [[Burning]] and the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] that immediately followed through the [[Early Renascence period]].

## Rebuilding of the City

Simply clearing the rubble and growths of the thorny, black [[nyxblight]] vines took weeks to complete, and afterwards much of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] needed to be rebuilt, repaired, or reinforced. The clearing efforts were attended to by the populace at large, save for those who were needed elsewhere. The rebuilding itself was also very much a populist effort, though major players included the [[Shipwrights Guild]], the [[Architects Guild]], the [[Materialists College]], and many of the [[Houses of Industry]].

The portion of the [[Old City]] that was razed in the [[Burning]] was built back up, this time by human hands rather than the [[Iconic pacts|iconic magics]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]]. This place would come to be called the [[Red Quarter]], separate from the still-standing remainder of the Old City known as the [[White Quarter]]. Other parts of the City, including the [[Duchy of Stilts]] where the human refugees had gathered, also required significant repairs.

### New defenses in the City

In addition to the building of the [[Red Quarter]], new defenses were devised and implemented to hopefully prevent losses such as this going forward. Though this particular enemy was thought to have been defeated, these defenses were heavily influenced by what humanity had learned during the [[Red Death period]].

The [[Red Death period City of Gardens#The warding line|warding line]] which had been constructed to prevent the spread of the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] transitioned to a permanent installation in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], with similar lines being installed in all of its many walls. The river [[Torrente]] itself would be extended with a number of canals that stretched throughout the City. Additionally, grid-based systems of torches and search lights were created so that humanity would be prepared to light up the City's [[rota]] at night if the need ever arose again.

## Recovering history

The loss of all human history – equally as devastating as the razing of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] during the [[Burning]] – from before the [[Red Death period]] was also counteracted throughout Reconstruction. In establishing [[Public Scholarship|Public Scholarship Law]], the [[Public Record]], and the [[Hall of Precedent]], the [[House of the Sun]] and its [[Orator]] sought to ensure the survival of human history and accessibility of these materials by the populace.
