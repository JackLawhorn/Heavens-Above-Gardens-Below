## The Heliotropic Age

### The Elven March

Along the [[Elven March]], the many [[Discoveries in the Known World|discoveries]] of the [[human clans]] included the great many plants – large and small – of the [[Known World]]. Purported by the [[Sun Elves]] as beings who feed on the light of [[Ylem]] itself and therefor close to divinity, these flora were of great interest to the human intellectuals. From their ranks rose the herbalists, who carried pouches of medicinal and mind-expanding herbs.

### The Later Heliotropic Age

In the [[Later Heliotropic Age]], the [[founding of Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] allowed humanity to further develop in their new, more permanent home. When constructing the urban sprawl of the [[rota]], the [[Oremongers Guild]] had largely preserved the gardens that preceded it. From the herbalists came the botanists whose charge it was to tend to these gardens and to cultivate flora across the City for a wide variety of purposes.

Consistent supply and access to these materials, along with the newly started mining efforts of the Oremongers Guild led during this time, gave rise to the first [[Materialist magics|materialists]]. Promising to equip humanity with powerful magics of their own, the [[Materialists College]] quickly gained prominence upon its founding and was even [[Naming of the Great Houses|named]] as a [[Great House]] of the [[Court]].

## The Crisis of Hubris

### The Early Crisis of Hubris

In the [[Early Crisis of Hubris]], the scholars of the [[Materialists College]] and the [[Oremongers Guild#assayers|assayers]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] co-led a series of experiments in the burgeoning field of alchemy. Inspired by the divinity of [[docetic materials]] found by the latter within the earth under [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], the alchemists sought to transform one medium into another and even to recreate or imbue [[extramundane]] properties.

These experiments were largely failures, despite significant financing by the [[Court]] and its [[Great House|Great Houses]]. Ironically, the first substantial success of the field of alchemy would come in the [[Early Renascence period]] with the development of [[quicksilver]], long after the fall of both the College and the Guild who began these experiments. With the [[fall of the Silver Wolves]] who controlled humanity's supply of [[Docetic materials#silver|silver]] and who alone were able to leverage its extramundane properties, the ability to fabricate quicksilver represented a powerful asset to the [[Blackpowder Guild]] and many other [[House|Houses]].

### The Red Death period

With the mass casualties of the [[Red Death period]], the [[Materialists College]] saw the rise of a new class of [[Scholars of the City#Objectivists|objectivist scholars]]: the anatomists. Desperate to find some asset among the corpses of the [[Red Court]] and their human victims alike, they studied the internal and external anatomy of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]]'s many corpses.

The discoveries of the anatomists held massive benefits in the fields of medicine and of course [[materialist magics]] as the scholars had hoped. They believed themselves to have found the physical, biological mechanisms through which one's [[albedo]] and [[aura]] function. Unfortunately, no mortal weakness of the Red Court was ever discovered.

### The Later Crisis of Hubris

The damage had already been done during the [[Red Death period]]: the anatomist scholars of the [[Materialists College]], unable to find a mortal weakness or even a single effective weapon against the [[Red Court]], succumbed to [[Madness]] and resorted to the dark and terrible science of [[Necromancy]]. Though not technically a new field fully separate from [[materialist magics]], the [[necromancer demons]] stalked and wiped out entire peoples of the [[Discoveries in the Known World|noble beasts]] and the [[Orior]], hoping to steal their organic magics for themselves.

This, of course, ultimately led to the [[fall of the Materialists College]] at the hands of the [[Sobek]] and the returned [[Sun Elves]], after which the necromancers were [[Fall of the Materialists College#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exiled]] from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]].

## The Renascence period

The [[fall of the Materialists College]] in the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]] more or less halted further developments in the field of [[materialist magics]] – at least those formally accepted by the scholarly community in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. Any further developments came at the hands of the [[Fall of the Materialists College#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exiled]] [[necromancer demons]] on their newly founded [[Isle of Melos]]. From this base of operations, this still-burgeoning field continued to flourish.
