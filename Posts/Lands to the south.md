South of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and the [[Sun Coast]] sits the [[Great Sea]]. Unseen by humanity until the [[Renascence|Renascence period]], the lands south of the Great Sea are referred to simply as the "lands to the south". Exposed to the [[nyxfire]] storms of the [[Wild Magics]] for significantly longer than the lands of the [[Old World]] continent, these mysterious frontiers hold arcane magics, artifacts, and peoples of their own.
