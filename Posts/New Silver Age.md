The New Silver Age is a [[cults|cult]] formed by the remnants of the [[Fall of the Silver Wolves|fallen]] [[Silver Wolves]] after their [[Sin of the Silver Wolves|departure]] from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] at the end of the [[Later Crisis of Hubris]]. Formed around a [[Luminary#Prophesy of the Luminary|prophesized]] messiah figure known as the [[Luminary]], the New Silver Age saw significant [[#Renascence decline|decline]] throughout the [[Renascence]] and today consists as a loose conglomeration of disparate, ineffectual subsects throughout the [[Known World]].

## Prophesy of the Luminary

The prophesy of the [[Luminary]] extends as far back into the history of [[Clan Wolfstepper]] as the forming of their [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]] with the [[Wolf Mother]] along the [[Elven March]]. Before the [[Red Death period]], before the [[Crisis of Hubris]] itself, the Clan had been told by the [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]] herself that her child would be borne of them one day and that this child would lead them, humanity, and all of the [[Known World]] into the future.

## History of the New Silver Age

### Knights of the Silver Age

The [[Luminary#prophesy of the Luminary|prophesy]] of the [[Luminary]] was passed down through the packs of [[Clan Wolfstepper]] and their elders for centuries. Those elders formed an order called the Knights of the Silver Age and safe-guarded an oral history – likely suggested by and certainly inspired by the [[Griot|Griots]] of the [[Sun Elves]] – of the prophesy so that the words of the [[Wolf Mother]] would not be forgotten.

In the [[Heliotropic Age]], the prophesy was no secret among the rest of humanity and in truth the [[Silver Wolves]] themselves were already as saviors to the vulnerable [[human clans]]. The human bards, it is thought, would have told stories and sang songs of the Luminary as well as more minor and generally fictional figures. With the losses of the Crisis of Hubris, however, Clan Wolfstepper and the knights of the Silver Age became more guarded with the prophesy of their lineage.

The devastating [[Fallen Houses|falls]] of each [[Great House]] – and especially the [[Oremongers Guild]], the [[Materialists College]], and the [[Disciples of the Pretender]] – did not heed well for the coming of the Luminary and what a hungry humanity might do. The [[Red Death period]] and the great [[Burning]] that ended it had destroyed all but the oral history of Clan Wolfstepper. The oral history was no longer told or sung of, nor did it enter into the [[House of the Sun]]'s [[Public Record]]. Temples to the Wolf Mother were rebuilt, but were not adorned with the words of the prophesy nor images depicting the Luminary themself.

### Fall of the Silver Wolves

> For more, see [[Fall of the Silver Wolves]].

When the [[Red Death period]] came to an end, so too did the [[Red Moon#Unrest among the Lunar Aspects|unrest]] of the[[ Lunar Aspects]] and most notably the [[Wolf Mother]] herself. Her influence in the [[Prime Material Sphere]] was all but lost, wounds inflected over months of heated battle with the [[Red Court]] in [[Red Court#Sphere of the Red Court|their extra-physical Sphere]]. If the [[Luminary#prophesy of the Luminary|prophesy]] of the [[Luminary]] was to come to fruition, it would come only years from then.

Sure enough, the [[Silver Wolves]] heard once again from their [[iconic pacts|patron]] [[Aspect]] less than a century later. The child was coming, one who would be borne of the daughter of the [[House of the Sun]]'s [[Orator]] and a son of [[Clan Wolfstepper]]. It was clear that neither protection of nor influence over the Luminary would not fall solely to the Clan. The reception of the other Orator, who would be the maternal grandmother of the child, was also a concern. After all, she had already lost one child who – in quite the cruel coincidence – had also been [[Pretender|purported to be a messiah]].

In the end, the Silver Wolves would leave [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] [[Sin of the Silver Wolves|one moonless knight]] with the mother, leaving behind even the rest of their clan. The Silver Wolves had [[Fallen Houses|fallen]] and the New Silver Age had been born.

### Renascence decline

The [[Luminary]] was born in the early months of the [[Renascence]], outside of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and into the pack that called itself the New Silver Age. The daughter of the [[Wolf Mother]] herself, child of the [[Nyx]], she displayed unique [[organic magics]] that diverged greatly from the [[iconic pact of Clan Wolfstepper]] but little else about her was extraordinary. Worse, the Wolf Mother fell silent completely with the birth of her daughter and, by all accounts, has not been heard of by a child of Clan Wolfstepper nor any creature since.

The [[cults|cult]], which had formed around her coming and which was now without the guidance of their [[Iconic pacts|patron]], was ultimately unable to capitalize on whatever course the [[Luminary#Prophesy of the Luminary|prophesy]] had seen for them. Over the course of an [[Ages of the Known World|age]] they have essentially disbanded, shattered into disparate and ineffectual subsects scattered throughout the [[Known World]]. The secessions began long before the departure of the Luminary herself, which was as a final blow to the New Silver Age.

## Role in the Known World

### Protectors, vagrants, and mercenaries

To the [[Questing Houses]] and their [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] far away from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and the jurisdiction of its [[Court]], the New Silver Age is many things. Some of its disparate subsects still pretend to be noble protectors of the [[Known World]]. Others are simply mercenaries, sell their services as vicious warriors and expert hunters and trackers to the highest bidder. Others still are vagrants and outlaws out in the wilds and on the remote roads that have only just begun to stretch across the Known World outside of the City. But most simply pass through the world disillusioned.

### The New Silver Age and the City

The members of the New Silver Age are, of course, exiled from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. They are remembered by humanity for their [[Sin of the Silver Wolves|sin]], just as the [[necromancer demons]] of fellow [[Fallen Houses|Fallen House]] the [[Materialists College]] are. The rest of [[Clan Wolfstepper]], who they left behind to be persecuted and held captive in the [[Argent Ghetto]], hate and revile them for the trauma of abandonment – first by their brethren then by the [[Wolf Mother]] herself – and persecution by the rest of humanity. The [[Bloodhounds]], brainwashed by the [[Jurisweard]], would gladly hunt such blood traitors down and tear them limb from limb.
