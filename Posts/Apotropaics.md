## Role in the City

The Apotropaics are a collection of disparate and often competing warrior classes, the protectors of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] throughout the [[Red Death period]]. They are scouts who patrol and reconnoiter the territory conceded to the enemy beyond the frontline as well as the soldiers who fight the [[Red Court]] in the streets. They are escorts and evacuators and those who guard the surviving populace.

This role has afforded them significant sway in the [[Red Death period City of Gardens]], which many have leveraged to forge a leadership role for themselves. They wage [[Campaigns against the Red Court]], maintain the peace within the communities of the survivors, and provide much needed supplies. Those who come from the [[Iconic House|Iconic Houses]] of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] have also fallen into roles as leaders of worship.

Some have taken the opposite path, taking advantage of their prominence to engage in illicit affairs hidden – or not – amongst the chaos. The [[Barony of Stilts]] and its [[Barony of Stilts#Shoals|Shoals]] became home to a number of different gangs, including the [[Rookish clans#Rookish Cloaks|Rookish Cloaks]] who rose to greater prominence during this time. The survivors were extorted by those who were meant to protect them: protection rackets that showed the worst of humanity.

## Weapons against the Red Court

Both the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] and the growths of [[nyxblight]] vine throughout [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] share a number of vulnerabilities that appear to be common across the [[Umbral Aspects]] and their accursed allies.

Fire and light are much-diluted forms of the divinity of [[Ylem]] and as such are deadly weapons against these foes. The Apotropaics arm themselves with torches and keep them lit across the [[Red Death period City of Gardens]], creating pockets of light in the darkness where they might be safe from harm. Flaming wards – massive pits and long walls of flame – are especially effective and can even be made mobile with carts. Offensively, weapons can not only keep enemies away but destroy them in a single well-placed strike. The [[#Torchbearer's Purifier clerics|Purifier clerics]] of the [[House of the Sun]] famously developed flint-striker blades which when struck erupt into flames, and the flaming arrows of the [[Rookish clans]] were a common sight in the dark of the City.

[[Docetic materials#Silver|Silver]], a [[Docetic materials|docetic material]] with extremely high [[Albedo]], is also extremely effective. The [[Silver Wolves]] wielded arms and armor of pure silver, and the [[#Wolfstepper Silversmiths|smiths]] of [[Clan Wolfstepper]] forged [[silvered]] spears, blades, and arrowheads to arm their allies. Even small trinkets and talismans – popular tools of the relatively powerless [[Materialist magics|materialists]] during this time – were enough to impose significant vulnerability upon the soldiers of the Red Court. Traps and wards could also be made of silver, both to keep the Red Court away from certain areas and to trap them within warding circles lined with the material.

Unlike the other Umbral Aspects, the soldiers of the Red Court also displayed some sort of fear of or aversion to water – specifically running water like that of the river [[Torrente]] and the sea water of the [[Sink]]. This was thought by the scholars of the [[Materialists College]] to be a physiological factor imposed by the [[Red Death]]. Because of this, humanity was able to find refuge within the newly founded [[Barony of Stilts]] and along the waterways flowing through the City.

## Classes of the Apotropaics

### Clan Wolfstepper

The [[Silver Wolves]] were best equipped to deal with the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] out of all of the [[human clans]] and [[House|Houses]]. Their [[Iconic pacts|iconic pact]] with the [[Wolf Mother]], [[Lunar Aspects|Lunar Aspect]] of the [[silver moon]] allowed them to take the form of a wolf and match the great size and ferocity of the [[Red Court#Apex Vectors|Apex Vectors]]. And they were well accustomed to patrolling the rooftops of the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]], even now still illuminated by the light of the [[Elven Signaltower]].

Their [[iconic pacts|patron]] [[Aspect]] also armed them with a significant arsenal of [[docetic materials#silver|silver]] which they used in its purest form to make their arms and armor. The pure silver was able to slice straight through both their enemy and the growths of [[nyxblight]] vines that had begun to strangle Omphalos, the City of Gardens.

Proficient silversmiths and humanity's best smiths after those of the [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|since-fallen]] [[Oremongers Guild]], [[Clan Wolfstepper]] armed not only their Silver Wolves but also many of the other classes of the Apotropaics. Though not forged from pure silver, they did wield [[silvered]] spears, blades, and arrowheads. A great many silver traps and wards were also developed, helping to protect the camps of the survivors and military command posts and to entrap and ensnare the enemy.

#### Berserkers of the Red Moon

The Apotropaic [[Silver Wolves]] of the [[Red Death period]] are infamous even now for their ferocity and bloodlust, which seemed to grow throughout their [[Campaigns against the Red Court|campaigns]] against the [[Red Court]]. Whether it was the stress and losses of the period or had to do with the [[Red Moon]] that sat in the [[Nyx]] above is unknown, but nevertheless they are called the Berserkers of the Red Moon.

The Berserkers were a faction that arose from within [[Clan Wolfstepper]] and was made up primarily of retired, disgraced, and suspended members of the [[Silver Wolves]]. For the most part, they shared a history of violence in common with each other and to a one had previously been either reprimanded or relieved of their positions. Running unsanctioned missions deep into enemy territory where the Red Court's [[Red Court#Apex Vectors|Apex Vectors]] and [[Red Court#Shambling Mounds|Shambling Mounds]] lay in wait, they were the most successful of the classes of the Apotropaics. They suffered the least losses, evacuated the most refugees from enemy territory, and boasted the greatest number of kills on record.

Rumors spread through the survivor camps that if attacked on patrol, the Berserkers would pursue their prey for several blocks before eliminating them with no casualties of their own. Their great strength afforded them much influence in the [[Red Death period City of Gardens]], and today they are best remembered for either leading a great many campaigns against the Red Court or for running a sizable, organized protection racket.

### Rookish chanticleers

The [[Rookish clans|Rookish]] warriors of this time are remembered as the chanticleers, flying under a [[labrum]] which displayed a rooster whose crows herald in a new day under a brilliant blue sky. Their ranged [[Combat Arts]] and the flaming and [[silvered]] arrowheads they wielded made them a force to be reckoned with.

Like the [[Silver Wolves]], they were well equipped to serve on the [[Red Death period City of Gardens#Frontline|frontlines]] and to flit into [[Red Death period City of Gardens#Enemy territory|enemy territory]]: already adapted to traversing the rooftops of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and possessed of a great speed such that they could out-pace and out-maneuver even the [[Red Court#Apex Vectors|Apex Vectors]] of the [[Red Court]]. Additionally, their [[Rookish clans#Raptor eyes|raptor eyes]] allowed them to see the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers of the Red Court]] hiding in the shadows and provide crucial intelligence to their fellow Apotropaics and the scholars searching for weapons to use against them.

#### Cardinals and the Rattlewatch

The [[Rookish clans|Rookish]] [[Rookish cardinals|cardinals]], who were leaders of worship among humanity in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and heads of the [[Canon of Heterodoxies]] after the [[Fall of House Lightbringer|fall]] of [[House Lightbringer]], were entirely wiped out during the [[Campaigns against the Red Court|campaigns]] against the [[Red Court]]. During the very first evacuations of the [[Red Death period]], they founded the Rattlewatch who flitted across the rooftops of the City alerting Apotropaics on the ground of enemy movements nearby and acting as bait to draw them away from civilians.

### House of the Sun Daywatch

The [[House of the Sun]], which had been been a relatively passive political entity in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and its [[Court]] since splitting off from the [[House Lightbringer]], now played a central role during the [[Red Death period]]. Their connection to both the [[Nyxfire motes]] and the [[Elven Signaltower]] made them indispensable to the [[Campaigns against the Red Court|campaigns]] against the [[Red Court]] who were weak to such divine magics.

Up atop the Signaltower, the [[House of the Sun#Signalkeepers|Signalkeepers]] served a vital role in tending to the [[nyxfire]] flame. Once it became apparent that the light of [[Ylem]] was their most effective defensive measure against the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers of the Red Court]], they began the [[Long Daylight]] during which the its flames burned at full force and illuminated the City below for months straight without end. This Daywatch was [[House of the Sun#Daywatch|forever changed]] by their noble station and the constant exposure to the magics of the [[Astral Sphere]], and would ultimately bring about the great [[Burning]].

On the ground, the House of the Sun primarily served as leaders of the survivors and as warders. These warders constructed great, flaming fire pits and pyres to deter advancements of the enemy, and were able to effectively pen them into what is now known as the [[Red Quarter]].

#### Torchbearer's Purifier clerics

A class of Apotropaics arose out of the [[House of the Sun]] in the [[Red Death period City of Gardens]] that called themselves the Purifiers. These clerics came from the same noble lineage as the fallen [[Fall of House Lightbringer|Captain Torchbearer]] who had left the City as part of [[House Lightbringer]]'s [[quest|questing party]], and boasted the greatest connection to the [[Nyxfire motes]] of any in that [[House]].

They patrolled the streets of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] equipped with firebombs and flint-striker blades that they could make erupt into flames. Filled with the same zeal and devotion to the light of [[Ylem]] as their forebears, they would walk into [[Red Death period City of Gardens#enemy territory|enemy territory]] alone if no others would join them, slicing through the [[nyxblight]] growths and the [[Soldiers of the Red Court|soldiers]] of the [[Red Court]] with ease. They were infamous for self immolating if injured, cornered, or infected, continuing on the good fight even in death.
