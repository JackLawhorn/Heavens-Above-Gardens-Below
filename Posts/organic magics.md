Organic magics are those that come from within, rather than from an outside source. Only the divine bioengineering of the [[Angels]] or the chaotic evolution of the [[Wild Magics]] can give a people magics of their own. These magic systems are typically unique to a single race of the [[Orior]] or to a group of related races.

Organic magics are closely related to [[materialist magics]], which are its natural byproduct.
