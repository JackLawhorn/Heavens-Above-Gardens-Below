Though the [[Republic]] would not be [[Birth of the Republic|born]] for another [[Ages of the Known World|age]], the first steps of the human diaspora away from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] were seen in the [[Early Renascence period]]. The hands of the [[Wayfarers Guild]] and the [[Questing Houses]] sowed seeds that would go on to grow into the greater Republic in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]].

## Colonies of the Wayfarers Guild

The [[Wayfarer colonies|colonies]] of the [[Wayfarers Guild]] stretch across the [[Old World continent]] to the north of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], their founders fleeing [[Decline of cland culture#Persecution of cland peoples|persecution]] for their [[cland]] heritage. Despite these lowly beginnings, the Guild would go on to constitute the majority of the [[Republic]]'s population centers and thus hold immense voting power in the [[Republic#Republican Court|Republican Court]].

The trails blazed by the [[Wayfarers Guild#Wayfarer caravans|Wayfarer caravans]] would go on to become a vast network of roads that connected the entire continent in both [[Transportation in the Known World|transportation]] and [[Communication in the Known World|communication]]. With the proliferation of [[House Talos]] and the [[Simulacra#Cheap labor|labor models]] of their [[simulacra]], these paths of packed dirt would be dug up and paved over in the most expansive construction and infrastructure project the [[Known World]] has ever seen.

## Colonies of the Questing Houses

The [[Questing Houses]] were the first to amass such power outside the [[Walls and gates of the City|walls]] of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] that the [[Court]] itself was made to flinch. Their [[Colonies of the Questing Houses|colonies]] on the [[Isles of the Great Sea|isles]] of the [[Great Sea]] and across the [[lands to the south]], brought riches and resources that humanity had never seen before. Armed in secret by the [[Blackpowder Guild]] and [[House Talos]] and their [[Engineers Guild]], they banded together in the [[Later Renascence period]] in what is remembered today as the [[Birth of the Republic|birth]] of the [[Republic]].

Too far for roads, these colonies are accessible and kept alive only by the [[Sink]]-faring vessels and shipping routes of the [[Shipwrights Guild]]. Despite their collective power both in the Republic and in the Court of the City, they remain reliant on this one strategic ally for their continued survival.
