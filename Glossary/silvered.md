# Silvered

Silvered arms are treated with a small amount of [[Docetic materials#Silver|silver]]. This might mean creating a weapon with a core of silver and a mundane outer layer, a spear that ends in a small silver tip, or a blade dipped in a silver coating.

This process extends a modicum of the [[docetic materials|docetic material]]'s [[extramundane]] properties to the weapon, including the ability to more effectively be used against the [[Umbral Aspects]] and other enemies of [[Dragon|Draconic]] heritage. At the same time, the cost of such weapons are significantly less than that of pure silver arms as it uses less of the material.
