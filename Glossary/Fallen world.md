# Fallen world

The [[Elven Legion|Elves]] referred to this world as a "fallen world," one whose peoples and their divine evolution were halted by some unknown cataclysm. By the time they arrived, the surface was ravaged by persisting [[Wild Magics]] storms of pure [[Nyxfire]] which warp the [[Laws of Power]] and reality itself.
