# The White Quarter

The "White Quarter" refers to the portion of the [[Old City]] that were not razed by the great [[Burning]] which ended the [[Red Death period]], and is named after the blinding white [[wol stone]] which the [[Oremongers Guild#Earth shapers|earth shapers]] of the [[Oremongers Guild]] called up out of the ground to built [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. The [[Scholars Quarter]], however, is often not included under the umbrella of the White Quarter.
