# Polar onyx deposits

Massive deposits of the [[Docetic materials|docetic material]] known as [[Docetic materials#Onyx|onyx]] that lay beneath [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. It is said that these deposits lock the [[Known World]] itself in its place in the wider [[Nyx]].

An extremely volatile and reactive material, the [[Mundial Aspects#Earth motes|earth motes]] were adamant that humanity and its [[Oremongers Guild]] not interfere with these deposits, and doing so ultimately led to their [[Fall of the Oremongers Guild|fall]].
