# Astral Wilds

An [[extramundane]] biome formed during and because of the raging [[nyxfire]] storms of the [[Wild Magics]] and the [[roiling of the elements]] that occurred after the [[fallen world|fall]] of the [[Old World]]. These Wilds blanket the east and it is said that the magics, though tamed, are so concentrated there that they warp the [[Laws of Power]] themselves.
