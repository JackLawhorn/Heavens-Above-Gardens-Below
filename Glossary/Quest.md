#Extra/Glossary 
# Quest

A broadly applicable term describing a mission, goal, or project of significance. A quest might range from success on the [[Sports and contest#calcio|calcio]] pitch, the creation of a [[Great Works|Great Work]], or even the founding of a new colony. In order to acquire the funds and supplies to afford such an endeavor, the individual or their [[House]] would stand before the [[Court]] seeking a [[Questing Charter]].

## Questing culture

Human society in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] has largely developed around what is referred to by some [[Scholars of the City#subjectivists|subjectivist scholars]] as "questing culture". The [[Elven tongue|Old Elven]] word "[[quest]]" was broadly applicable to the life of the [[Sun Elves]] of the [[Elven Legion|Legion]], perfectly encapsulating not only their eternal [[Elven March|March]] across the infinite worlds of the [[Nyx]], but also smaller objectives like individual campaigns, battles, and even sporting contests. To the humans, who developed from pitiful wretches under the mentorship of the Elves, the word came to mean any initiative taken in aspiration towards greatness and especially taken in worship of [[Ylem]] and its many [[Aspect|Aspects]].

The products of such quests are visible everywhere in the City, and in fact her own construction by the [[Oremongers Guild]] and the [[human clans]] of the [[Later Heliotropic Age]] was a worthy quest in their own time. These products are often referred to as [[Great Works]], though not all Great Works are the results of quests and not all quests produce a Great Work. There are so many of these works that some opponents of [[History of the Subjective#First Wave Henotheism|First]] and [[History of the Subjective#Second Wave Henotheism|Second Wave Henotheism]] have even criticized their prevalence throughout the City by referring to it as the "City of Monuments" rather than the "City of Gardens".
