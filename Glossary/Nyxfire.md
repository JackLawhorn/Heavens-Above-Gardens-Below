# Nyxfire

The divine flames and physical form of [[Ylem]], nyxfire is an unstoppable force of pure magic taking two primary forms: flames and bolts. Both are governed in the [[Known World]] by elemental [[Nyxfire motes]].

The nyxfire itself has been bound by the [[Angels]] whose control maintains the campaigns against the [[Glossary/Dragon]] and all of unreality. Rebels against this control are branded [[Wild Magics]].
