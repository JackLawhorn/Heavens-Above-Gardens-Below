# Orator

---

From each of the [[Great House|Great Houses]], an Orator is plucked to preside over matters of the [[Court]], sacrificing the House's voting power. The position of Orator is the highest individual seat of power in the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City]] and across the [[Post-Enlightenment Era|Post-Enlightenment]] republic. Among other roles, the Orators moderate Court debates, discussions, and negotiations, and select the [[Hand of the Court]] on a case-by-case basis.

Since the [[Crisis of Hubris]] and the [[Fallen House|fall]] of a majority of the Great Houses, only the Orator of the [[House of the Sun]] remains.
