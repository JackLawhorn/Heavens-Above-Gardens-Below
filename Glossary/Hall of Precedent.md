# The Hall of Precedent

Administered to by [[House of the Sun]] [[House of the Sun#House of the Sun Aides|Aides]], the [[Court]]'s House of Precedent archives all rulings of its [[House|Houses]] and of the [[Orator|Orators]] of the [[Great House|Great Houses]]. Recorded for all perpetuity, past rulings are referenced in future matters of the Court and its definitions of the law inform peace-keeping efforts of the agents of the [[Jurisweard]].

The Hall itself is a part of the [[Public Record]], ensuring that these materials are forever available to the populace of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] for reference.
