# The Beastlands

The Beastlands are a great expanse of seemingly endless frontier south of the [[Great Sea]]. Also known as the "Cradle of the [[Orior]]", a great many more races of the Orior have been found here by the [[Sun Elves]] and later by humanity's [[Questing Houses]].

These peoples were afforded more time to develop in the chaos of the [[Wild Magics]]' [[nyxfire]] storms, and emerged with more complete histories, cultures, and [[organic magics]] of their own.
