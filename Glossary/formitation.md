# Formitation

Formitation is a process that is common in the [[Ylem]] – especially [[Nyxfire motes]] and the [[Major Aspects]] – by which [[docetic]] form mirrors or imitates the physical form of those it is interacting with or perceived by. A common example is that the [[Mundial Aspects#water motes|water motes]] appear with a humanoid form to humanity, while instead appearing as the [[Sobek]] and their patron [[Ylem]] before them.
