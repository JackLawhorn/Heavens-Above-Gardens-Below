# Quicksilver

A synthetic medium developed in the [[Early Renascence period]] by the descendants of the [[History of materialist magics#The Early Crisis of Hubris|alchemists]]. It is the sole such achievement in the experiments of the alchemists, coming an age after the disbanding of their scholars.

An approximation of the [[docetic]] material of [[docetic materials#silver|silver]], quicksilver could be manufactured with relative ease and its [[extramundane]] properties accessible by more than just the [[Silver Wolves]]. Its most common use is in the form of quicksilver ammunition, which are mass produced and a powerful weapon in the hands of the vulnerable post-[[Crisis of Hubris]] humanity.
