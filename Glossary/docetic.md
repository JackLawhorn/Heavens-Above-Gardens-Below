#Extra/Glossary 
# Docetic

"Docetic" describes a form shaped from divine or otherwise [[extramundane]] powers rather than originating from the [[Prime Material Sphere]]. Docetic form is not of flesh and bone or the atomic components of physical materials but divinity imitating life. It is most commonly used to describe the nature of [[Ylem]], some [[Aspect|Aspects]] of which have forms within the Prime Material Sphere but which are truly formed of the magics and the flames of the [[nyxfire]] itself.
