# Great House

---

In the [[Later Heliotropic Age]], four Great Houses were chosen to represent the judgement of the populace and preside over matters of the [[Court]]. These initial Great Houses were the [[Silver Wolves]], the [[Oremongers Guild]], [[House Lightbringer]], and the [[Materialists College]].

Later, when House Lightbringer departed from [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] on their [[House Lightbringer's Questing Charter|Quest into Oblivion]], they left behind remnants that would become the [[House of the Sun]] in their place as a Great House.

Later in the [[Crisis of Hubris]], the rise of the [[Pretender]] and socio-political pressure to deal with the threat he represented led to the Court granting his [[Disciples of the Pretender|Disciples]] Great Houseship along with their [[Questing Charter]].

Since the Crisis of Hubris and the [[Fallen House|fall]] of a majority of these Great Houses, only the [[House of the Sun]] remains.
