# The Red Quarter

The "Red Quarter" refers to the portion of [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] that was razed during the great [[Burning]] that ended the [[Red Death period]]. It is named after both the [[Red Court]] and its [[Red Death|plague]], as well as the color of the rooftops chosen during [[Reconstruction]] to memorialize this loss.
