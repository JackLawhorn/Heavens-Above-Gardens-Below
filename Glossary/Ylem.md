# Ylem

Ylem is the Elven name for the magic itself, the source of creation. It birthed the [[Laws of Power]], thus waging war against unreality: the [[Glossary/Dragon]]. Ylem exists in all things, but its physical manifestation is known as [[nyxfire]].

The ruling class of Ylem is the [[Angels]], who bound their own forms of pure magic in armor of stone. Rebels against this control are branded [[Wild Magics]].
