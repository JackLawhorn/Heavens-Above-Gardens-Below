The coastline north of the [[Great Sea]] and the southernmost reach of the [[Old World continent]]. Named both after [[Ylem]] and for the divine light of the [[Elven Signaltower]] and its [[nyxfire]] flames.

On the Sun Coast sits the center of the [[Known World]], marked by massive [[polar onyx deposit|polar onyx deposits]], and it is here that [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] was founded by the [[Sun Elves]] and by the [[human clans]].]
