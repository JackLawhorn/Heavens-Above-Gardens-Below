# The Great Dark Cold

The [[Known World]]'s furthest point from the light and warmth of the [[Elven Signaltower]], it is said that this desolate frontier is where the [[Fallen world|fall]] of the [[Old World]] began. From the scarce accounts of the [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March#Remnants of the Legion|remnants of the Legion]], it would seem that all that remains are a land so devoid of the magics and of the light of [[Ylem]] that the [[Sun Elves]] themselves nearly succumbed to the darkness of the [[Dragon]].

The Great Dark Cold lay at the end of the [[Elven Legion]]'s [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March|Post-Heliotropic March]], and it is from there that they [[Post-Heliotropic Elven March#Departure of the Elven Legion|departed]] from the Known World and journeyed back out into the greater [[Nyx]].
