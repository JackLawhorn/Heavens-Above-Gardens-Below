# Noble beasts

Some races of beasts of the [[Known World]], which the [[Sun Elves]] of the [[Elven Legion]] called the "noble beasts", are able to learn and speak the [[Elven tongue]]. Most if not all of them also possess some form of [[organic magics]], which mages may gain access to through forming [[mutualist pacts]] with them.
