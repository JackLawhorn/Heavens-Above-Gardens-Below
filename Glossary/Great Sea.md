# The Great Sea

A massive body of salt water that lays between the [[Sun Coast]], the [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens|City of Gardens]], and the rest of the [[Old World continent]] to the north and the [[Beastlands]] to the south. To its east lies the base of the great [[Nyxblight Tree]], beyond which is nothing but the perilous [[Astral Wilds]].

Dotting the Great Sea are a great many isles, varied in size, resources, and tactical or strategic value. In the [[Renascence|Renascence period]], these would quickly become settled by the [[Questing Houses]] – including [[House Talos]] and its [[Garden of Simulacra]] – as well as by the [[Necromancer demons]] of the [[Fall of the Materialists College#Exile and flight of the necromancers|exiled]] [[Materialists College]] on the [[Isle of Melos]].
