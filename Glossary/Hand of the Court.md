# Hand of the Court

---

The rulings of the [[Court]] are executed upon by the Hand of the Court, a [[House]] or other body selected by the [[Orator|Orator(s)]] to do so on a case-by-case basis. Before the Orators' decision is given, any House may volunteer to indicate interest which the Orator will take into account.

Until their [[fall of the Silver Wolves|fall]] at the tail end of the [[Crisis of Hubris]], the [[Silver Wolves]] were often the de facto choice of any Orator. Even compared to the other four [[Fallen Houses]], the Silver Wolves were respected and trusted to successfully and efficiently complete their quest. Afterwards, the role most often fell to the many warrior classes of the [[Jurisweard]].

Now, the [[Psionics College]] holds so much influence in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era|Post-Enlightenment]] republic that almost any conflict will be assigned to them and their many agents.
