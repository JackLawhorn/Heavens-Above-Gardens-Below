# The Public Record

Created by the [[House of the Sun]] during the [[Reconstruction]] that followed the [[Red Death period]], the Public Record records all of humanity's collective history and is constantly updated with the goings on of the [[Court]] and of all who live within [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]]. As the name suggests, these materials are a public utility and accessible at any time by the populace for reference and for various scholarly efforts.
