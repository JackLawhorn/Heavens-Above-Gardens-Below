# Shades

Biomes cast in the stark shadow of [[nyxfire]] and its divine light. This magical phenomenon is most often caused by proximity to large burns of pure nyxfire.

So devoid are the Shades of magical energy that even most [[Ylem]] fear to tread there. They are most infamous for their native Ylem – [[Umbral Aspects]] known as the [[shade motes]] – which are the stark shadows of these lands given life of their own.
