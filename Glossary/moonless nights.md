# Moonless night

Nights when the lunar forms of the [[Lunar Aspects]] are wholly [[benighted]], rendering them effectively blind. Moonless nights can and have been instigated by the Lunar Aspects themselves, purposefully blinding themselves to the goings on of the [[Known World]] as in the case of the [[fall of the Silver Wolves]].
