# Sol

Sol (plural "solas") is a universal unit of measurement used by the [[Elven Legion]] that is equal to one day's work. The word itself is [[Elven tongue|Old Elven]] and is imparted to those who learn the Elven tongue. It is, in fact, so old that the [[Sun Elves]] had already adopted the word "day" rather than using "sol" as a unit of time before making [[nyxfall]] on the [[Known World]].

One sol of distance can be traveled in one day, regardless of means of transport which are instead contextual. In other words, one sol of travel on land may mean by foot or on a mount or cart. One sol over water would mean one day's swim to the Elves but typically one day's travel on a seafaring vessel to the humans.

One sol of production is similarly contextual. One sol of a crop will be much greater in volume than one sol of a smith's blades. This use is especially valuable in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]], where the [[Houses of Industry]] trade on such production. With the implementation of the [[currencies of the City]], the value of one gold coin was set at one sol of work and has stayed that way ever since. This is referred to as the "sol standard".
