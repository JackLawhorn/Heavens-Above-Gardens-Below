# The Moon-Touched

A rare, natural phenomena of the [[Nyx]] and its children the [[Lunar Aspects]]. The Moon-Touched are the children of the Lunar Aspects, born of a race of the [[Orior]] but in possession of powerful [[organic magics]].

The most infamous example of this is the [[Moon-Touched princess]] – prophesized child of the [[Orator]]'s daughter and her [[Silver Wolves|Silver Wolf]] lover, kidnapped by the [[New Silver Age]].
