# Heavens Above; Gardens Below

---

[[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] is a sprawling, coastal city state and the sole bastion of humanity in a world shaped by the wanton, unchecked actions of gods and monsters. In these posts I'll focus primarily on humanity both within and outside of the City of Gardens, but the [[Known World]] is full of other inhabitants from the [[Discoveries in the Known World#Noble beasts|noble beasts]] to the other races of the [[Orior]] to a chaotic pantheon of deities known as the [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]]. And this world itself is but a single backwater planet in the greater cosmos of the [[Nyx]], itself sentient and in engulfed in eternal conflict.

After the disastrous [[Crisis of Hubris]], a cultural and intellectual [[Renascence]] has armed humanity with a tenuous grasp of powerful technological and magical advancements, as well as a hunger to prove themselves. Now, in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]] and long after the age of heroes and villains has passed, a complex political body known as the [[Court]] attempts to lead their people into a golden age of colonialist expansion.

Governed by a ruling class of historian mages, a shadowy college of psionic scholar spies, and powerful unions of political entities with diverse and oft-conflicting interests, will this new era prove to be the first step towards their extinction or towards their ascension to godhood?

## Themes and inspiration

Heavens Above; Gardens Below is a fantasy setting inspired by the diverse cultures of Mediterranean Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. It was created as the transmedia backdrop for stories about power and consequences, the impact of history and failure on culture and identity, and the origins of the ideas and concepts that define us.

I detail specific themes and inspirations in weekly #ThemeThursday posts, which you can find a list of here:
