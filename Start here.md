# Heavens Above; Gardens Below

---

[[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] is a sprawling, coastal city state and the sole bastion of humanity in a world shaped by the wanton, unchecked actions of gods and monsters. In these posts I'll focus primarily on humanity both within and outside of the City of Gardens, but the [[Known World]] is full of other inhabitants from the [[Discoveries in the Known World#Noble beasts|noble beasts]] to the other races of the [[Orior]] to a chaotic pantheon of deities known as the [[Aspect|Aspects]] of [[Ylem]]. And this world itself is but a single backwater planet in the greater cosmos of the [[Nyx]], itself sentient and in engulfed in eternal conflict.

After the disastrous [[Crisis of Hubris]], a cultural and intellectual [[Renascence]] has armed humanity with a tenuous grasp of powerful technological and magical advancements, as well as a hunger to prove themselves. Now, in the [[Post-Enlightenment Era]] and long after the age of heroes and villains has passed, a complex political body known as the [[Court]] attempts to lead their people into a golden age of colonialist expansion.

Governed by a ruling class of historian mages, a shadowy college of psionic scholar spies, and powerful unions of political entities with diverse and oft-conflicting interests, will this new era prove to be the first step towards their extinction or towards their ascension to godhood?

## Themes and inspiration

Heavens Above; Gardens Below is a fantasy setting inspired by the diverse cultures of Mediterranean Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. It was created as the transmedia backdrop for stories about power and consequences, the impact of history and failure on culture and identity, and the origins of the ideas and concepts that define us.

I detail specific themes and inspirations in weekly #ThemeThursday posts, which you can find a list of here:

## Release schedule and goals

I am writing one blog post every day throughout 2023, based on daily prompts that help me to categorize my thoughts and keep the exercise fresh. I might not always be entirely caught up because life happens and the #SceneSunday posts are harder to get through than I initially thought ðŸ˜‚

Here is a list of my daily writing prompts:

- #SceneSunday â€“ Specific moments in the history of this world, used to highlight much of the information being written in the other daily prompts and to give a feel of what living in this world might be like from the perspective of humans like us.

- #MagicSystemMonday â€“ There are a TON of magic systems in this setting! These posts will seek to make sense of them, their mechanics, how they are used, and what the consequences are for the wider world. For more, see [[Magics in the Known World]].

- #TimelineTuesday â€“ Similarly, the timeline of this world covers a TON of ground. These posts will define set periods commonly referenced to place events and concepts in relative order. For more, see [[Ages of the Known World]].

- #WorldWednesday â€“ Although the majority of this content will focus around humanity in [[Omphalos, the City of Gardens]] and their colonies expanding outward from it, these posts will help me to flesh out the entirety of the [[Known World]].

- #ThemeThursday â€“ My approach to worldbuilding relies heavily on themes I want to incorporate and inspiration from external sources (both real-world and fictional). These posts will directly address these subjects. For more, see [[#Themes and inspiration]].

- #FactionFriday â€“ The history of the Known World covers thousands of years of time, and my approach has been to focus primarily on the rise and fall of factions and dynasties rather than individuals. These posts will help me flesh out important groups.

- #CivilizationSaturday â€“ These posts will outline specific details and traits of Omphalos, the City of Gardens, as well as other population centers throughout the Known World. This might include anything from districts of the City to culture and society.
